# Bird Strike Database
## Overview
Designed, implemented, and queried a relational database given only a dirty CSV file. Designed entity-relation model, developed queries, visualized data, and implemented a stored procedure. Learned MySQL, relational database design/implementation, and data visualization in R. Delivered reproduceable R markdown notebook.
## Comments
This was an interesting project to work on because we were free to control each aspect of the database. Forming entities, attributes, and relations was a terrific exercise on how I might implement a database for an actual company that has a lot of unorganized and dirty data. I also learned a lot about R, especially when it comes to data manipulation and modeling.
## File Summary
- `BirdStrikesData.csv`: this file contains the raw data on which we modeled the database and populated the tables.
- `Room5ERD_v3.png`: this is an image of our entity-relation diagram for our database. It also shows up in the R Markdown file.
- `Group5.Practicum1.CS5200Fa21.v4.Rmd`: This file contains all code for this project, including connecting to an empty database, loading the CSV file, creating the database schema, and updating the tables with data from the CSV. There are also several SQL queries, some light analysis/visualization, and implementation of a stored procedure.
- `Group5.Practicum1.CS5200Fa21.v4.Rmd`: knitted PDF version of the Rmd file. Useful as a reference if there are issues running certain cells in the Rmd file due to encoding issues, etc.
