# Q2
The first step is to connect to a local MySQL database. The database used by our group was named "bird_strike". You can use a different connection method to connect to any local or remote database, as long as the correct syntax is used.
```{r}
#install.packages('RMySQL') # Uncomment to install RMySQL package
library(RMySQL)

# Connect to local MySQL database
db_user <- 'root'
db_password <- 'abcd1234' # Substitute your root-user password
db_name <- 'bird_strike' # Substitute your empty MySQL database name
db_host <- 'localhost'
db_port <- 3306

# Create new database connection
dbcon <- dbConnect(MySQL(), user = db_user, password = db_password,
                 dbname = db_name, host = db_host, port = db_port)
```
We now begin our data definition language. For the strike table, we created each attribute to not be null, as this ensures that any incomplete entries that would not provide useful information are excluded. Additionally, we used ENUM types instead of separate tables for the `impact_to_flight`, `flight_phase`, and `sky_conditions` attributes. This is because the distribution of each value was fairly linear, and greatly simplified the cleaning and insertion of our data. Additionally, since most of these values were not equivalent to NULL, the space savings from creating a separate table would be minimal, especially since ENUM types are resolved to an integer instead of a string, which saves a lot of space.
```{sql connection=dbcon}
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS strike
```

```{sql connection=dbcon}
CREATE TABLE strike (
  strike_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
  aircraft_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES aircraft(aircraft_id),
  airport_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES airport(airport_id),
  wildlife_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES wildlife(wildlife_id),
  number_wildlife_struck INTEGER NOT NULL,
  impact_to_flight ENUM('None', 'Engine Shut Down', 'Aborted Take-off', 'Precautionary Landing', 'Other'),
  strike_date DATE,
  damage_inflicted INTEGER NOT NULL,
  airline_operator VARCHAR(50),
  flight_phase ENUM('Approach', 'Climb', 'Descent', 'Parked', 'Take-off run', 'Taxi', 'Landing Roll'),
  sky_conditions ENUM('No Cloud', 'Some Cloud', 'Overcast') NOT NULL,
  wildlife_remains_collected INTEGER NOT NULL,
  remarks TEXT NOT NULL,
  pilot_warned INTEGER,
  dollar_cost INTEGER NOT NULL,
  feet_above_ground INTEGER,
  number_people_injured INTEGER NOT NULL
)
```
We now begin the DDL for the aircraft table:
```{sql connection=dbcon}
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS aircraft
```

```{sql connection=dbcon}
CREATE TABLE aircraft (
  aircraft_id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  aircraft_type_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES aircraft_type(aircraft_type_id),
  aircraft_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  is_large INTEGER,
  number_engines INTEGER
)
```
Now, the aircraft_type table:
```{sql connection=dbcon}
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS aircraft_type
```

```{sql connection=dbcon}
CREATE TABLE aircraft_type (
  aircraft_type_id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  type_name VARCHAR(50)
)
```
Next, the airport table:
```{sql connection=dbcon}
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS airport
```

```{sql connection=dbcon}
CREATE TABLE airport (
  airport_id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  airport_name VARCHAR(50),
  state VARCHAR(20)
)
```
The wildlife table:
```{sql connection=dbcon}
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS wildlife
```

```{sql connection=dbcon}
CREATE TABLE wildlife (
  wildlife_id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  wildlife_species VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  wildlife_size ENUM('Small', 'Medium', 'Large')
)
```
The precipitation table:
```{sql connection=dbcon}
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS precipitation
```

```{sql connection=dbcon}
CREATE TABLE precipitation (
  precipitation_id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  condition_name ENUM('Fog', 'Rain', 'Snow', 'None')
)
```
The strike_precipitation relationship table:
```{sql connection=dbcon}
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS strike_precipitation
```

```{sql connection=dbcon}
CREATE TABLE strike_precipitation (
  strike_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES strike(strike_id),
  precipitation_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES precipitation(precipitation_id),
  PRIMARY KEY (strike_id, precipitation_id)
)
```
Now that our database schema is defined, we can import the data from a CSV file, clean it in R, and insert it into our database.

# Q3
The first step is to read the raw data from the CSV file into an R data frame:
```{r}
fn = "BirdStrikesData.csv" # Path to CSV file
data <- read.csv(file = fn,
                 header = T,
                 stringsAsFactors = F)
# Use heac(data) to check Record_ID column name. 
head(data) # Uncomment to check data frame
```
Next, we remove any records without flight or aircraft information, and transform the attribute values to fit the data types of the corresponding columns of our database schema:
```{r}
# Omit records without flight or aircraft information.
valid_data <- subset(data, Aircraft..Type != "" & Aircraft..Make.Model != "" & Aircraft..Number.of.engines. != "" & Is.Aircraft.Large. != "" & FlightDate != "" & When..Phase.of.flight != "" & Feet.above.ground != "", select = colnames(data))

# Modify data format
valid_data[valid_data == "Yes"] <- 1
valid_data[valid_data == TRUE] <- 1
valid_data[valid_data == "Y"] <- 1
valid_data[valid_data == "Caused damage"] <- 1
valid_data[valid_data == "No"] <- 0
valid_data[valid_data == FALSE] <- 0
valid_data[valid_data == "N"] <- 0
valid_data[valid_data == "No damage"] <- 0
valid_data$FlightDate = as.Date(valid_data$FlightDate, "%m/%d/%Y")

#head(valid_data) # Uncomment to check data frame
```
Next, we retrieve the unique precipitation values:
```{r}
# Retrieve precipitation results
precipitations <- valid_data[,c('Conditions..Precipitation'), drop = F]
precipitations <- precipitations[!duplicated(precipitations), ]
print(precipitations)
```
Since we have 3 possible values for precipitation, we will create a record for each of these unique individual values:
```{sql connection=dbcon}
/* Insert precipitations */
INSERT INTO precipitation VALUES 
(1, 'Snow'),
(2, 'Fog'),
(3, 'Rain');
```
Query the precipitation table to confirm our insertions were successful:
```{sql connection=dbcon}
SELECT * FROM precipitation;
```
Next, we create a data frame with the unique aircraft types:
```{r}
# Retrieve aircraft types
aircraft_type <- valid_data[,c('Aircraft..Type'), drop = F]
aircraft_type <- aircraft_type[!duplicated(aircraft_type), ]
print(aircraft_type)
```
There is only one, so we can easily insert it:
```{sql connection=dbcon}
/* Insert precipitations */
INSERT INTO aircraft_type VALUES (1, 'Airplane');
```
Confirm our insertion was successful:
```{sql connection=dbcon}
SELECT * FROM aircraft_type;
```
Now, we create a data frame for the aircraft, and insert the values into our database:
```{r}
# Insert aircraft
aircrafts <- valid_data[,c('Aircraft..Make.Model', 'Is.Aircraft.Large.', 'Aircraft..Number.of.engines.')]
aircrafts <- cbind(1, aircrafts[, 1:ncol(aircrafts)])
aircrafts <- aircrafts[!duplicated(aircrafts), ]
colnames(aircrafts) <- c("aircraft_type_id","aircraft_name", "is_large", "number_engines")
aircrafts <- cbind(1, aircrafts[, 1:ncol(aircrafts)])
n.aircrafts <- nrow(aircrafts)
aircrafts[,1] <- seq(1, n.aircrafts)
colnames(aircrafts)[1] <- "aircraft_id"
dbSendQuery(dbcon, "SET GLOBAL local_infile = true;")
dbWriteTable(dbcon, value = aircrafts, name = "aircraft", append = T, row.names = F) 
```
Confirm successful insertion:
```{sql connection=dbcon}
SELECT * FROM aircraft;
```
Now, we insert the airports:
```{r}
# Insert airports
airports <- valid_data[,c('Airport..Name','Origin.State')]
airports <- airports[!duplicated(airports), ]
airports <- cbind(1, airports[, 1:ncol(airports)])
n.airports <- nrow(airports)
airports[,1] <- seq(1, n.airports)
colnames(airports) <- c("airport_id", "airport_name","state")
dbWriteTable(dbcon, value = airports, name = "airport", append = T, row.names = F) 
```
Confirm successful insertion:
```{sql connection=dbcon}
SELECT * FROM airport;
```
Next, insert the wildlife:
```{r}
# Insert wildlife
wildlife <- valid_data[,c('Wildlife..Species', 'Wildlife..Size')]
wildlife <- wildlife[!duplicated(wildlife), ]
wildlife <- cbind(1, wildlife[, 1:ncol(wildlife)])
n.wildlife <- nrow(wildlife)
wildlife[,1] <- seq(1, n.wildlife)
colnames(wildlife) <- c("wildlife_id", "wildlife_species","wildlife_size")
dbWriteTable(dbcon, value = wildlife, name = "wildlife", append = T, row.names = F)
```
Confirm insertion:
```{sql connection=dbcon}
SELECT * FROM wildlife;
```
Now, we insert the strike information:
```{r}
# Insert strikes
strikes <- valid_data[,c('Record.ID', 'Wildlife..Number.Struck.Actual', 'Effect..Impact.to.flight', 'FlightDate', 'Effect..Indicated.Damage', 'Aircraft..Airline.Operator', 'When..Phase.of.flight', 'Conditions..Sky', 'Remains.of.wildlife.collected.', 'Remarks', 'Pilot.warned.of.birds.or.wildlife.', 'Cost..Total..', 'Feet.above.ground', 'Number.of.people.injured')]
colnames(strikes) <- c("strike_id", "number_wildlife_struck", "impact_to_flight","strike_date", "damage_inflicted", "airline_operator", "flight_phase", "sky_conditions", "wildlife_remains_collected", "remarks", "pilot_warned", "dollar_cost", "feet_above_ground", "number_people_injured")

strikes <- cbind(strikes[1],1,strikes[,2:ncol(strikes)])
strikes <- cbind(strikes[1],1,strikes[,2:ncol(strikes)])
strikes <- cbind(strikes[1],1,strikes[,2:ncol(strikes)])
colnames(strikes)[2] <- "aircraft_id"
colnames(strikes)[3] <- "airport_id"
colnames(strikes)[4] <- "wildlife_id"

n.strikes <- nrow(strikes)
# process each row (strike) one by one
for (r in 1:n.strikes) {
  # find the aircraft, airport and wildlife PK for that strike
  a <- aircrafts$aircraft_id[which(aircrafts$aircraft_name == valid_data$Aircraft..Make.Model[r] & aircrafts$is_large == valid_data$Is.Aircraft.Large.[r] & aircrafts$number_engines == valid_data$Aircraft..Number.of.engines.[r])]
  
  b <- airports$airport_id[which(airports$airport_name == valid_data$Airport..Name[r] & airports$state == valid_data$Origin.State[r])]
  
  c <- wildlife$wildlife_id[which(wildlife$wildlife_species == valid_data$Wildlife..Species[r] & wildlife$wildlife_size == valid_data$	
Wildlife..Size[r])]
  
  strikes$aircraft_id[r] <- a
  strikes$airport_id[r] <- b
  strikes$wildlife_id[r] <- c
}

dbWriteTable(dbcon, value = strikes, name = "strike", append = T, row.names = F)
```
Confirm insertion:
```{sql connection=dbcon}
SELECT strike_id,strike_date,airline_operator,impact_to_flight,flight_phase FROM strike;
```
Next, we insert the rows for the strike_precipitation relationship table:
```{r}
# Insert snow precipitations
snow <- dplyr::filter(valid_data, grepl('Snow', Conditions..Precipitation))
snow <- snow[,c('Record.ID'), drop = F]
snow <- cbind(snow[1], 1)
colnames(snow) <- c("strike_id","precipitation_id")
dbWriteTable(dbcon, value = snow, name = "strike_precipitation", append = T, row.names = F)

# Insert fog precipitations
fog <- dplyr::filter(valid_data, grepl('Fog', Conditions..Precipitation))
fog <- fog[,c('Record.ID'), drop = F]
fog <- cbind(fog[1], 2)
colnames(fog) <- c("strike_id","precipitation_id")
dbWriteTable(dbcon, value = fog, name = "strike_precipitation", append = T, row.names = F)

# Insert rain precipitations
rain <- dplyr::filter(valid_data, grepl('Rain', Conditions..Precipitation))
rain <- rain[,c('Record.ID'), drop = F]
rain <- cbind(rain[1], 3)
colnames(rain) <- c("strike_id","precipitation_id")
dbWriteTable(dbcon, value = rain, name = "strike_precipitation", append = T, row.names = F)
```
Confirm insertion:
```{sql connection=dbcon}
SELECT * FROM strike_precipitation;
```

# Q4
The first query will return the number of bird strikes during the climb or take-off phases by airline:
```{sql connection=dbcon}
SELECT airline_operator, Count(*) AS num_strikes
FROM strike
WHERE flight_phase = 'Climb' OR 'Take-off Run'
GROUP BY airline_operator
```

# Q5
The second query will return the airports with the greatest number of bird strikes:
```{sql connection=dbcon}
SELECT airport_name, Count(*) AS num_strikes
FROM strike s JOIN Airport a ON (s.airport_id = a.airport_id)
GROUP BY airport_name
ORDER BY num_strikes DESC
```

# Q6
The third query will return the number of strikes by year:
```{sql connection=dbcon}
SELECT YEAR(strike_date) AS Year, Count(strike_date) AS Strikes
FROM strike
GROUP BY YEAR(strike_date)
```
# Q7
We will now create a column chart that compares the number of bird strikes during take-off or climb and compare it to the number of strikes during approach, descent, and landing from 2008-2011.

The first step is to return the climb-phase strikes and return a data frame containing the information we want:
```{sql connection=dbcon, output.var="raw_data_climbing_q7"}
SELECT YEAR(strike_date) AS Year, COUNT(*) AS Num, 'Climbing' AS Phase
FROM strike
WHERE YEAR(strike_date) >= 2008 AND YEAR(strike_date) <=2011 AND (flight_phase = 'Take-off run' OR flight_phase ='Climbing' )
GROUP BY YEAR(strike_date)
```
Next, we do the same for the descent phase:
```{sql connection=dbcon, output.var="raw_data_descending_q7"}
SELECT YEAR(strike_date) AS Year, COUNT(*) AS Num, 'Descending' AS Phase
FROM strike
WHERE YEAR(strike_date) >= 2008 AND YEAR(strike_date) <=2011 AND (flight_phase = 'Approach' OR flight_phase = 'Descent' OR flight_phase = 'Landing Roll')
GROUP BY YEAR(strike_date)
```
Now, we combine the results of the two queries and create our chart:
```{r}
#install.packages("ggplot2","dplyr") # Uncomment to install packages
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Concatenate climb/descent data into the same data frame
concatenated_data = rbind(raw_data_climbing_q7,raw_data_descending_q7) %>%
  mutate(Year=as.character(Year)) # Character type makes plot look better
#head(concatenated_data) # Uncomment to check data frame

# Create column chart object
chart <- ggplot(concatenated_data, aes(x=Year, y=Num, fill=Phase)) +
                geom_bar(stat='identity',position=position_dodge()) +
                geom_text(aes(label=Num), position=position_dodge(width=0.9), vjust=-0.25) +
                labs(title='Bird Strikes for Flight Phase Categories (2008-2011)',
                     subtitle='Climbing Phases: Take-off run, Climbing\nDescending Phases: Descent, Approach, Landing Turn',
                     x='Year', y='Number of Strikes')

chart
```

# Q8
Our stored procedure will take the name of an airline as an input, then delete the rows in the strike and strike_precipitation tables corresponding to that airline. It is important do delete from both tables to assure data integrity.
```{sql connection=dbcon}
DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS delete_airline
```
We can delete the appropriate rows from both tables by using a left join:
```{sql connection=dbcon}
CREATE PROCEDURE delete_airline (IN airline VARCHAR(50))
BEGIN
  DELETE strike, strike_precipitation
  FROM strike
    LEFT JOIN strike_precipitation
    ON strike.strike_id = strike_precipitation.strike_id
  WHERE strike.airline_operator=airline;
END
```
We query the number of strikes by airline:
```{sql connection=dbcon}
SELECT airline_operator, Count(*) AS num_strikes
FROM strike
GROUP BY airline_operator
ORDER BY num_strikes DESC
```
The 'BUSINESS' airline has a lot of records, so we will select it to be our test case. Let's query the strike_precipitation table to see if it has any records for precipitation:
```{sql connection=dbcon}
SELECT s.airline_operator, p.precipitation_id, COUNT(*) AS Total
FROM strike AS s
  JOIN strike_precipitation AS p
  ON s.strike_id=p.strike_id
WHERE s.airline_operator='BUSINESS'
GROUP BY precipitation_id
```
It has records for each precipitation type, and will be a good test case. We call our stored procedure with the 'BUSINESS' airline:
```{sql connection=dbcon}
CALL delete_airline('BUSINESS')
```
Now, we repeat our queries to confirm that all records from this airline were deleted:
```{sql connection=dbcon}
SELECT airline_operator, Count(*) AS num_strikes
FROM strike
GROUP BY airline_operator
ORDER BY num_strikes DESC
```
All the 'BUSINESS' strikes are gone! Next, we need to check the strike_precipitation table
```{sql connection=dbcon}
SELECT s.airline_operator, p.precipitation_id, COUNT(*) AS Total
FROM strike AS s
  JOIN strike_precipitation AS p
  ON s.strike_id=p.strike_id
WHERE s.airline_operator='BUSINESS'
GROUP BY precipitation_id
```
Finally, we disconnect from the database.
```{r}
dbDisconnect(dbcon)
```
