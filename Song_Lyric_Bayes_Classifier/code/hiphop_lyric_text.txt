Yeah

I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey

I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh

The city's cold and empty (Oh)
No one's around to judge me (Oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust

I'm just calling back to let you know (Back to let you know)
I could never say it on the phone (Say it on the phone)
Will never let you go this time (Ooh)

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch

Pullin' out the coupe at the lot
Told 'em fuck 12, fuck SWAT
Bustin' all the bells out the box
I just hit a lick with the box
Had to put the stick in the box, mmh
Pour up the whole damn seal, I'ma get lazy
I got the mojo deals, we been trappin' like the '80s
She sucked a nigga soul, gotta Cash App
Told 'em wipe a nigga nose, say slatt, slatt
I won't never sell my soul, and I can back that
And I really wanna know where you at, at

I was out back where the stash at
Cruise the city in a bulletproof Cadillac (Skrrt)
'Cause I know these niggas after where the bag at (Yeah)
Gotta move smarter, gotta move harder
Nigga try to get me for my water
I'll lay his ass down, on my son, on my daughter
I had the Draco with me, Dwayne Carter
Lotta niggas out here playin', ain't ballin'
I done put my whole arm in the rim, Vince Carter (Yeah)
And I know probably get a key for the quarter
Shawty barely seen in double C's, I bought 'em
Got a bitch that's looking like Aaliyah, she a model
I got the pink slip, all my whips is key-less
Compton, I'm about to get the key to the city
Patek like the sea, forgive me

Pullin' out the coupe at the lot
Told 'em fuck 12, fuck SWAT
Bustin' all the bells out the box
I just hit a lick with the box
Had to put the stick in the box, mmh
Pour up the whole damn seal, I'ma get lazy
I got the mojo deals, we been trappin' like the '80s
She sucked a nigga soul, gotta Cash App
Told 'em wipe a nigga nose, say slatt, slatt
I won't never sell my soul, and I can back that
And I really wanna know where you at, at, hah

Hahaha, I been movin' 'em out
If Steelo with me, then he got the blues in the pouch (Yeah)
Took her to the forest, put the wood in her mouth
Bitch, don't wear no shoes in my house
The private I'm flyin' in, I never wan' fly again
I'll take my chances in traffic (Yeah)
She suckin' on dick, no hands with it
I just made the Rollie plain like a landing strip
I'm a 2020 president candidate
I done put a hundred bands on Zimmerman, shit
I been movin' real gangster, so that's why she picked a Crip
Shawty call me Crisco 'cause I pop my shit
Got it out the mud, there's nothin' you can tell me, yeah
When I had the drugs, I was street wealthy, yeah

Pullin' out the coupe at the lot
Told 'em fuck 12, fuck SWAT
Bustin' all the bells out the box
I just hit a lick with the box
Had to put the stick in the box, mmh
Pour up the whole damn seal, I'ma get lazy

Workin' on a weekend like usual
Way off in the deep end like usual
Niggas swear they passed us, they doin' too much
Haven't done my taxes, I'm too turnt up
Virgil got a Patek on my wrist goin' nuts
Niggas caught me slippin' once, okay, so what?
Someone hit your block up, I'd tell you if it was us
Manor house in Rosewood, this shit too plush

Say my days are numbered, but I keep wakin' up
Know you see my texts, baby, please say some'
Wine by the glass, your man a cheapskate, huh?
Niggas gotta move off my release day, huh
Bitch, this is fame, not clout
I don't even know what that's about, watch your mouth
Baby got a ego twice the size of the crib
I can never tell her shit, it is what it is (What)
Said what I had to and did what I did (Ayy)
Never turn my back on FBG, God forbid
Virgil got the Patek on my wrist doin' front flips
Givin' you my number, but don't hit me on no dumb shit

I done flew one out to Spain to be in my domain and Audemars-ed the bitch, woo
Dropped three dollars on a ring, cost a Bentley truck, lil' bitch, woo
I was in the trap servin' cocaine, I ain't been the same since, woo

Granny, she was standin' right there while I catch a play on a brick, woo
I make them lil' niggas go haywire, Taliban in this bitch, woo
I done been down bad in them trenches, had to ride with that stick, woo
Who gave you pills? Who gave you that dust? Pluto sent you on a lick, woo
Too many convicts that roll with me to play in this shit, woo
I'm tryna avoid nonsense, get Osama spray in this bitch, woo
They at the candlelight lightin' it up, nigga, anybody can get it, woo
I'm on a PJ lightin' it up, Backwood full of sticky, woo
I'm tryna tote that Draco in London and it's extended, woo
They gotta stretch a nigga out, we gon' die for this shit, woo
Yeah, I ride for my niggas, I lie to my bitch, woo
We some poor, high-class niggas, made it, we rich, yeah
I was at the bando, got a penthouse for a closet, woo
It's like a chandelier on my neck, my wrist, woo
I got pink toes that talk different languages, woo
Got Promethazine in my blood and Percocet, yeah

I'm in the loop with the voo, I'm in the loop with the woo, which one you workin'?
I'll put your face on the news, I'll put the pussy on the shirt after I murk it
Then make 'em go shoot up the hearse, cost me a quarter bird, nigga, it's worth it
And you a maniac, a fuckin' alien, how you splurgin'?
Got that kitty cat, I'm havin' fun with that, goin' Birkin

Swipe the Chase, ooh, now she wanna date, yeah
Straight to Nobu on the coast, ooh
Shorty only like cocaine and Whole Foods
Yeah, snappin' all up on the 'Gram, ass going crazy (Woo)
Now she wanna fuck me in the foreign, goin' 80

Up in Malibu, uh, Malibu
If you ain't got a foreign, then she laugh at you, uh

Spending daddy's money with a attitude

Roxanne (Roxanne), Roxanne (Roxanne)
All she wanna do is party all night (All night, yeah)
Goddamn (Goddamn), Roxanne (Roxanne)
Never gonna love me, but it's alright (Alright, yeah)
She think I'm an asshole, she think I'm a player

Pussy like water, I'm unbothered and relaxing
I would never trip on a nigga if I had him
Bitch, that's my trash, you the maid, so you bagged him, ah

Eat me and record it, but your edge-up all I'm showing (Ah)

If it ain't about the money, then you know I'm gon' ignore it
I'm the shit, ooh (Ayy)
I need a mop to clean the floor, it's too much drip, ooh (Too much drip, ooh)
I keep a knot, I keep a watch, I keep a whip, ooh (I keep a whip, baow)

Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so

It's been a long time since you fell in love
You ain't coming out your shell, you ain't really been yourself
Tell me, what must I do? (Do tell, my love)
'Cause luckily I'm good at reading
I wouldn't bug him, but he won't stop cheesin'
And we can dance all day around it
If you frontin', I'll be bouncing
If you want it, scream it, shout it, babe
Before I leave you dry

Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so

I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so (Yeah)

Let me check my chest, my breath right quick (Ha)
He ain't ever seen it in a dress like this (Ah)
He ain't ever even been impressed like this
Prolly why I got him quiet on the set like zip
Like it, love it, need it, bad
Take it, own it, steal it, fast
Boy, stop playing, grab my ass
Why you actin' like you shy? (Hot)
Shut it, save it, keep it pushin'
Why you beating 'round the bush?
Knowin' you want all this woman
Never knock it 'til you try (Yah, yah)
All of them bitches hating I have you with me
All of my niggas sayin' you mad committed
Realer than anybody you had, and pretty
All of the body-ody, the ass and titties

Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so
Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment
I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so?
Didn't even notice, no punches left to roll with
You got to keep me focused; you want it? Say so

Got a dance, but it's really on some street shit

Left foot up, right foot, slide
Basically, I'm sayin' either way we 'bout to slide, ayy

I could give you thug passion (Passion)

This that drip, it's more like oceans
They can't fit me in a Trojan
Out of pocket, but I'm always in my bag
Yeah, that's the slogan
This that, "Who's all there?"
I'm pullin' up wit' a emo chick that's broken

This that college dropout music
Every day leg day, she be too thick
And my friends are all annoying
But we go dumb, yeah, we go stupid

Talk to me, I need to hear you need me like I need ya
Fall for me, I wanna know you feel how I feel for you, love
Before you, baby, I was numb, drown out pain by pourin' up
Speedin' fast on the run, never wanna get caught up
Now you're the one that I'm callin'
Swore I thought I'd never fall again, don't think I'm just talkin'
I think I might go all in, no exceptions, girl, I need ya

Feeling like I'm out of my mind, 'cause I can't get enough
Only one that I give my time, 'cause I got eyes for ya
Might make an exception for ya, 'cause I been feelin' ya
Think I might be out of my mind, I think that you're the one

My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything

Will never give my all again
'Cause I'm sick of falling down
When I open up and give my trust
They find a way to break it down
Break down
Tear me up inside
When you break me down

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

Tired of beefin' you bums, you can't even pay me enough to react
Been wakin' up in the crib and sometimes I don't even know where I'm at
Please don't play that nigga songs in this party, I can't even listen to that
Anytime that I ran into somebody, it must be a victory lap, ayy
Shawty, come sit on my lap, ayy, they sayin' Drizzy just snap
Distance between us is not like a store, this isn't a closeable gap, ayy
I've seen some niggas attack and don't end up makin' it back

I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

I'm in the trenches, relax
Can you not play that lil' boy in the club? 'Cause we do not listen to rats
We in Atlanta, I buy her a wig, she tellin' me Tae is the best
Point at the nigga who act like a killer, but you only one from the 'net
I'm like DaBaby, I'm not just a rapper, you play with me, you gon' get stretched
Ooh-oh
Bring Drake to the hood, surround Drake around Dracs
Even though I got a case, I'ma do what it take
And I never been embraced
And the money's hard to make
So I bet they on they face right now

I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby
We took a trip, now we on your block and it's like a ghost town, baby
Where do these niggas be at when they say they doin' all this and all that?

When he tell the story, that's not how it went
Know they be lyin', a hundred percent
Moved out the Ritz and forgot 'bout the Bent'
Valet just called me to tell me come get it
Knocked that boy off and I don't want no credit
If it was me, they wouldn't regret it
Left me for dead and now they wan' dead it, yeah
Heart is still beatin', my niggas still eatin'
Backyard, it look like the Garden of Eden
Pillow talk with 'em, she spillin' the tea
And then shawty came back and said she didn't mean it
It's hard to believe it

I know that they at the crib goin' crazy, down bad
What they had didn't last, damn, baby

Sometimes we laugh and sometimes we cry, but I guess you know now, baby
I took a half and she took the whole thing, slow down, baby

Mustard on the beat, ho

I put the new Forgis on the Jeep
I trap until the bloody bottoms is underneath
'Cause all my niggas got it out the streets
I keep a hundred racks inside my jeans
I remember hittin' the mall with the whole team
Now a nigga can't answer calls 'cause I'm ballin'
I was wakin' up, gettin' racks in the morning
I was broke, now I'm rich, these niggas salty

All this designer on my body got me drip, drip, ayy
Straight up out the Yajects, I'm a big Crip
If I got a pint of lean, I'ma sip, sip
I run the racks up with my queen like London and Nip
But I got rich on all these niggas, I didn't forget, back
I had to go through the struggle, I didn't forget that
I hopped inside of the Maybach and now I can sit back
These bitches know me now 'cause I got them big racks
'Cause I'm gettin' money now, I know you heard that
Young nigga on the corner, bitch, I had to serve crack
Uncle fronted me some P's, had to get them birds back
We came up on dirty money, I gave it a birdbath
Cut off the brain and I give my bitch a new coupe
Either you from the Yah Gang or you're SuWoop
Got a New Orleans bitch and man, that pussy voodoo
And I'm that nigga now, who knew?

I put the new Forgis on the Jeep
I trap until the bloody bottoms is underneath
'Cause all my niggas got it out the streets
I keep a hundred racks inside my jeans

I been wakin' up to get the money, woah, woah
Got a bad bitch, her ass tatted, woah, woah
Givenchy to my toes, two twins, I'm fucking 'em both
I put her in a new AP, the water like a boat
I was down bad on my dick, where was you niggas at?
I know you turned your back on me just to get some racks
I seen you swerve back, 'cause I'm in the black 'Bach
New diamonds on me, fuck a flash, this ain't Snapchat
'Cause I been gettin' paid
Yellow diamonds on me look like lemonade
Got my baby mama that new Bentayga
Tryna get the dough, Joe, like a sensei, yeah
Rolls Royce umbrellas when I'm in the rain
I just mind my business
I got brothers that did the time, I ain't kiddin'
All these rappers just talk about it, I live it
Goin' up, I ain't got no sky limit, yeah, yeah, yeah

La bonnasse a fait claquer son cul, elle n'a pas besoin d'applaudir
Haute couture comme Goyard
G-Wagen ou la Rover ?
Je mets quelques bijoux sur toi parce-que tu as un cœur froid
Je sais que je dois garder ma bimbo d'à plomb, plomb, plomb
Abaisse ton cul sur le sol-sol, ouais
Ahh, woah
Tu n'auras plus jamais affaire à aucun de ces négros

Si on saute dans la Benz ça te va ?
Ca te va si je t'appelle mon bébé Prada ?
Je ne suis pas un joueur, j'ai juste plein de gos
Mais laisse-moi te dire, je t'apprécie beaucoup, bébé
Je veux juste commencer sur la poitrine et tes dessous, bébé
Je sais que tu veux la chaussure avec la semelle rouge, bébé
Tu sais que j'aime quand tu chevauches par-dessus moi, bébé

Elle veut du chane-nel, Dio'-or
Je fais que de l'oseille, je n'ai pas besoin de promo
Je fais irruption au top, j'suis dans la mesure à quatre temps
Dans la coco
J'ai un sentiment, je le garde dans mon cœur
Et je garde une Patek, aussi, parce-que je fais pas dans Versace
Tu vois mes diamants même si je suis dans l'obscurité
Et depuis que tu l'as compris, je te fais monter et faire tout ce que tu veux faire

Si je la prends par derrière, elle va faire le trottoir
Si elle a une meilleure amie avec elle, je la prends de retour dans mon loft
Je la fais devenir sauvage à cinq heures du mat'
Et son nom c'est pas Megan mais c'est tellement un bon coup
J'ai dû garder mes putes divisés, des membres que je tirais dessus dans la vallée
Et tu sais que je prends son âme quand elle chevauche
Son sweat et ses baskets toutes signées Kenzo
Shawty sait la faire balancer bas comme une meuf en trans à chaque fois qu'on y va sur la drogue comme
Timbo, woah, woah, woah

See I done been lied to, backstabbed, and heartbroken
I wanted to cry but I was too afraid to open
Prayin’ one day I’d find a peace of mind by the ocean
I spent all my time committing crimes to get closer
While at my nana house I play the couch, starin' at the ceiling
Tryin’ not to get in my feelings
Thinkin' of a way I could make these millions
Maybe that'll take this pain away and clear up all these rainy days, yeah

Got the head from her, I ain't even wanna fuck (Fuck her)
Why? Slut, bye (Fuck on)
Nothin' on me from Saks, everything Revive
Old nigga tellin' on bro, should've died
No, he ain't kill 'em, dawg, he ain't even try
Still'll bet my last shootin' dice in the hood
Take who chain? Nah bitch, not Dugg's
Probably in somethin' fast with a Glock in the hood
Courtside tickets, spillin' Wock' on the wood

First turnt nigga from the hood, they curious
Four in cars, 'bout five in jewelry
I get the commas with numbers, that's period
I got your BM wan' put on Amiris
First young nigga in the A with two Lams
Run up fourteen mil', started fourteen grams (Same day)
Dope boy Dickies and diamonds and Timbs
You shouldn't play with that boy, he is not one of them
Bro, I kept taking L's, finally got me a M
Still making double, I don't count what I spend
S550 2018
Gotta come twenty if you hoppin' in the Benz
Young turnt nigga from the D to the A
I'm rockin' with the Lions, yeah, I'm rocking with the Braves
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we paid
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we paid

I'ma turn it up a lil' more this time
Used to dream about gettin' it, now I got it, I don't drive
I had a spot like The Varsity, what'll you have?
You buy twenty, I'll front what you buy
I put on drip, I believe I can I fly
Niggas know that I'm rich, but they know not to try
I had a show in Detroit and I stopped at Revive
And spent fifty on all of the guys
All of these hoes in these stores make commission
And plus I'ma tip 'em, they holdin' my size
Get in your car and just put on your flashers
And follow the hearse since you say you gon' ride
'Cause somebody gon' die if they fuck with us
Turn a five to a dime, that's a double up
Fuck around, walk through church with my double cup
This shit a habit, I'm prayin' I give it up
Tiger stay with the wood, make 'em give it up
Know I ran through a mil' every week coppin' weed
Bruh beat the charge, I can get me some sleep
Got a backend to pick up, I won't even leave
Run it up, fuck around, give the 'Vette to DT
Keep a hotboy with me, I got love for BG
Chasin' this paper since twelve or thirteen
Runnin' 'round in these streets, it was me and Marquise

First turnt nigga from the hood, they curious
Four in cars, 'bout five in jewelry
I get the commas with numbers, that's period
I got your BM wan' put on Amiris

Ох, да ты просто монстр

Я могу выпить бутылку. Алкоголь - и я, словно Гадзилла
Попаду в колоду, будто крупье в казино
Весь мой сквад тут на тусе ходит туда-сюда
Помесь зомби апокалипсиса и Бобби Хинана "Мозга" я
Ведь со мной вновь сражается также моя же мания
Shady вернулся, взрывать пора
Говоришь, от меня клонит в сон тебя?
Вот тогда тебе бессоница
У тебя дефицит внимания, успокойся и слушай сейчас меня
Чел, выпей коньяка
Убью из АК с кулака, для меня это не больше, чем игра
Отсякай, видишь меня отступай, тут орёт тревога
Этот бит сумасшедший, смешной (хах), как будто Ray J
Угараю по дороге до банка, брызжа слюной, вам не успокоить
Во мне...

Монстра
Встанешь на пути моём, скормлю тебя монстру
Весь день такой как ты, но ночью превращаюсь в монстра
При свете луны, что сияет так ясно
Я становлюсь злодеем. Это мой блокбастер
Гадзилла, всё в огне, я монстр
В крови ковёр луи ви, в крови весь танцпол
Всё горит, Гадзилла, всё в огне, я монстр
В крови ковёр луи ви, в крови весь танцпол

Я лишь продукт Слика Рика из Оникса, своим треком их ужасну
Разозлю, хоть их сотни всех. Невозможно даже перечесть
И вдобавок ко всему этому я в психушке в руках верчу
Магический шар
В попытках узнать, каково будет завтра:
После рисперидона будет ли шанс?
Мой кулак, будто карандаш, чертит круги на стене
Черти кричат все во мне
Эта песня даст веру тебе
Ты направил свой ствол на парня с базукой в руке
Я из Лох-Несса вылез, прямо из мифов
Как только грохну свой полтиник водки
Лишь откручу крышку, ты увидишь...

Монстра
Встанешь на пути моём, скормлю тебя монстру
Весь день такой как ты, но ночью превращаюсь в монстра
При свете луны, что сияет так ясно
Я становлюсь злодеем. Это мой блокбастер
Гадзилла, всё в огне, я монстр
В крови ковёр луи ви, в крови весь танцпол
Всё горит, Гадзилла, всё в огне, я монстр
В крови ковёр луи ви, в крови весь танцпол

Если тебе так же пох, руки вверх!
Ведь я уже собрался в отдых. Бэд Трип подъехал
Нахожусь на месте, как мой индекс, теперь всё, что ты увидишь
Лишь мой средний палец, подниму выше!
Как у меня могут быть только фаны?
Горю, как у лжеца память
Я не думал вас даже оставить без восхищений текстами
И эти дамы прекрасны, меня заводят опасно
И я их очаровал всех, они теряют сознание
И всё снова крутится, крутится, словно цепь бензопилы
Я машу волшебной палочкой, как битой, исполню мечты
Сука, я сделал эти бабки слишком просто как Кид Инк
Называй меня Дидди
Создаю группы, что мне дают прибыль
Слышь, я в игре, скуп на делёж, что принадлежит мне
Я не дам слова тебе, не притворюсь даже, мэн
Но я сказал суке, что женюсь на ней, если она после будет в земле
Я как Ричард Рамирес ебашу людей
Не стою на месте, как Кристиан Ривера
Все мои тексты вихляют подобно мне
Как при параличе, это страшно, я зову что Гарри Карей
Ведь каждый Том. Дик и Гарри всегда имеют грёбанный словарь при себе
Это смешно и нелепо. Ведь они подобно мне
Трясутся над ним, божатся, клянутся над ним
Пришло время пересечься с глазу на глаз с этой острой проблемой
Пора быстрее, составить некролог о каждом. Теперь и мне похер, поверь
Пора палить, зарядил ствол, полон чернил он
Злая половина меня сместит вновь, и людей привлекают мои тексты всё ещё
Он смотрят на них, как на гангстеров
Будто я буду щас стрелять всех
Каждый трей, как джингл, в магазин вложил их
Теперь пришло время их всех положить!
Наполняю ядом и рядом перебиваю
Другими словами, я из них соки выжимаю
Не хотел убивать всех, но я в приступе ярости
Ты не в силах сбежать теперь, я не чувствую жалости
Они меня ненавидят, и я не знаю усталости, и вот я настигаю их
И перемалываю в ярости
Я чувствую, будто бы стал на голову тронутым, во мне демон
И я знаю, он по крови их голоден
Либо ты убиваешь, либо убит будешь скоро ты, я подорву тебя
И раскидаю в разные стороны
Моя каждая часть сделана из зла и насилия
Если ты меня увидишь, то поверь, ты бессилен
Убегай или молись, но никак не беси меня, или в ту же минуту
Я разорву на куски тебя
Ты не станешь как я даже на пару процентов
Я собираюсь покончить с тобой, ты знаешь об этом
Меня подобные тебе вызывают на бэттл, но я не победим
Вовсе не убиваем и неподелен
Переделываю строки и не знаю предела я
У меня есть много денег, они раскиданы в трейлере
Я не боюсь потянутся за моим...
Чел стой
Смотри что в планах!
Хах

A love letter came through the mail, it said, "I miss you"
I ripped it up and flushed with the tissue, try to forget you
I ain't got nothing against you, we human, we all got issues
But I'm tired of being tired of being tired
That part of me done died
I see it, then I don't, act like I'm blind
I'm confident it won't be one of mine
I know emotions come with lies, so I tell the truth all the time
Ain't got no sympathy for no bitch
I admit that I'm rich and I'm lit
Jumpin' up on stages, I get two hundred an occasion
Bro had really fucked the game up, we made niggas shut they trap down
They see how I made it, I'm the reason they won't rap now
See me out in traffic, make a hater pull his hat down
The biggest OG's salute me, a stylist can't even style me
The robbers probably wanna get me, I'm hoppin' out Lamborghinis
The youngins turn in my city, they try me, I get it cracking
Some of this still would happen if I never had started rapping
My people them still steady trapping and they still be getting active
I tell 'em to chill, I'm tryna run up these M's
Paid cash and then he post the crib (Nah)
I can't show nobody where my mama live, that's how I 'posed to feel
My niece just asked me were my diamonds real, I said, "Of course"
I just played the hand that I was dealt, didn't have to force
All around the world they know it's me, they hear my voice
And I done it all in a pair of Diors, yeah

Young age, learned how to get paid (We gon' get the money)
Big stage, long way from Section 8 (Ballin' other countries)
Big wave, he gon' have to get saved (Big old wave)
Ridin' in the foreign, chiefin' on the forest
I know I wasn't there for you, at least I said I'm sorry
You know what it was, I told you that I was heartless
I'm emotionally scarred, that ain't even your fault
But don't listen to them haters tryna fill your ears with salt

All this revenue coming in, I'll probably never spend
I just bought my BM a Benz, now that's another Benz
I just cut off all of my friends and brought my brothers in
I don't see nobody but me, who I'm gon' lose to?
I can't move around without tools, these niggas loose screws
I can see me taking the lead over the new school
They remember me from selling weed at my old school
Only hit it once and now it's old news
Blew up, who the fuck would knew? Paint my Trackhawk Nipsey Blue
If I get one, you get one too, I really move how bosses move
I never call myself a G.O.A.T., I leave that up to the people
Everybody can't go to the top, I had to leave some people
I'ma be forever scheming, woke up, I thought I was dreaming
Watched my lil' boy play with toys, I just dropped a tear of joy
Some shit that I feel for
I been going crazy with that scoring, call me Baby Harden
They say I'll be great, I guess I'm waiting for it

Young age, learned how to get paid (We gon' get the money)
Big stage, long way from Section 8 (Ballin' other countries)
Big wave, he gon' have to get saved (Big old wave)
Ridin' in the foreign, chiefin' on the forest
I know I wasn't there for you, at least I said I'm sorry
You know what it was, I told you that I was heartless
I'm emotionally scarred, that ain't even your fault
But don't listen to them haters tryna fill your ears with salt
Young age, learned how to get paid (We gon' get the money)
Big stage, long way from Section 8 (Ballin' other countries)

When I take the molly, I'm a savage
Uh, I say, uh

Ayy, my girl the definition of a bad bitch
Stole her heart, I'm the definition of a bandit

Put the Percs down and picked up the jiggas, jiggas, jiggas
Tommy in the fucking Tommy Hilfiger, ’figer, ’figer
That Tommy hit a nigga, Tommy Hilfiger, fuck niggas
I'm nice, when I’m high off the pills, I'ma fuck with her
I don't smoke skunk, but tonight I'm getting stuck, nigga
Pour the codeine up and put some molly in the cup with it
I know she a freak, uh-huh, she gon’ fuck with it
She my velcro, uh-huh, guess I'm stuck with her
I dive in it like a sailor, I love to nail her
Addicted to her paraphernalia, I had to tell her
I see it like a fortune teller
Your ex-nigga did good, I could do better
Bad bitch from the woods, I think she a hunter
She a killer and an eater, she a Jeffrey Dahmer
I can tell when she in her feelings, I can read her like a book
No TEC, no Beretta, FN on me, am I understood?
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't need no molly to be savage, uh
When I'm on that molly, I feel savage, uh, uh
She the definition of a bad bitch
Stole her, I'm the definition of a bandit, uh, ayy
I don't need no molly to be savage, uh, ayy
But when I'm on the molly, I feel savage
Ayy, my girl the definition of a bad bitch
Stole her heart, I'm the definition of a bandit

My brother point her out and she a bad bitch, I'm on her
Must ain't heard that I'm a savage, once I get a bitch, I own her
I see she got swag, I got cash so I want her
See this four-five in my pants, put on your ass, push up on bruh
Shawty, she a rider with that glizzy on her (Glizzy on her)
And shawty, I'ma dada with no semi on me (Semi on me)
If we got a problem, we get rid of homie (Yeah)
Put twenty thousand in your pocket, we gon' get the money (Yeah)
I'm the definition of a bandit (Honest)
Took your heart from out his hands and still ain't saying shit (On my mama)
Some new killers in my circle you done ran with
Like this dirty .38, this bitch'll damage
Popping wheelies, 4K Trey, call when you land with it (Pop, pop, pop)
I let you drive and slide with my bros where they be laying with it (Skrrt)
I work this bitch, I open up a can with it
Like fuck the stove, I make it jump without my hand in it

I don't need no molly to be savage, uh
When I'm on that molly, I feel savage, uh, uh
She the definition of a bad bitch
Stole her, I'm the definition of a bandit, uh, ayy
I don't need no molly to be savage, uh, ayy
But when I'm on the molly, I feel savage
Ayy, my girl the definition of a bad bitch

She drinkin' Four Lokos, I can't get with those
She wan' give me toto, I tell her come close
She say, "You say you love me, but I don't know what love means"
I ask her who got her heart, 'cause damn, that nigga lucky
I been tryna reach for it, but it's too far above me
I ain't never do you wrong, so tell me why you don't trust me
She don't do this often, she said it's only because me
You the one who want it, therefore you can never judge me
She just wanna party and nothing's wrong with that
Every time I'm calling, she say she gon' call me back

Del avión al maldito helicóptero, sí
La poli viene como si repartiera drogas, no, no
Soy una estrella de pop, no un doctor

Soy una estrella de pop, no un doctor ni un observador
Dice que representa un barrio completamente diferente así que la bloqueé
Ocupado en la casa, cocinando salmón con la langosta
Si hablamos de Jordans solo soy yo y David Foster

Acabo de llegar a Whitney Houston Texas, por la tarde
Me dicen la misma historia tanto como empiezan a creerla

Llorando en mi mano y yo de verdad estoy jugando keep-away
Esa mierda normalmente no se hace tan grande sin una cara de Bieber
Mordedura, mordedura, pan comido, mordedura, mordedura, Turcas y Caicos, sí, sí
Ve y tráele a tus amigos, podemos fugarnos, sí, sí
Sí, mantego un, como mantego la fe
¿Piensas en como me convertí así? Juro que tengo el

Putas llamando a mi celular como si estuviera encerrada siempre
Del avión al maldito helicóptero, sí
La poli viene como si repartiera drogas, no, no
Soy una estrella de pop, no un doctor
Putas llamando a mi celular como si estuviera encerrada siempre
Del avión al maldito helicóptero, sí
La poli viene como si repartiera drogas, no, no
Soy una estrella de pop, no un doctor

Protests and growing national outcry continues over the death of George Floyd (Section 8 just straight cooked this motherfucker up)
Last night, people protesting in Minneapolis escalated
As demonstrators were lashed by tear gas and rubber bullets
The main message here, the main message here, the main message here
Is that they want to see those officers involved
They want to see those officers arrested
Officers arrested
(I can't breathe, I can't breathe)

Trade my 4x4 for a G63, ain't no more free Lil Steve
I gave 'em chance and chance and chance again, I even done told them please
I find it crazy the police'll shoot you and know that you dead, but still tell you to freeze
Fucked up, I seen what I seen
I guess that mean hold him down if he say he can't breathe
It's too many mothers that's grieving
They killing us for no reason
Been going on for too long to get even
Throw us in cages like dogs and hyenas
I went to court and they sent me to prison
My mama was crushed when they said I can't leave
First I was drunk, then I sobered up quick
When I heard all that time that they gave to Taleeb
He got a life sentence plus
We just some products of our environment
How the fuck they gon' blame us?
You can't fight fire with fire
I know, but at least we can turn up the flames some
Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
I be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces
Fucked up, the way that we livin' is not getting better, you gotta know how to survive
Crazy, I had to tell all of my loved ones to carry a gun when they going outside
Stare in the mirror whenever you drive
Overprotective, go crazy for mine
You gotta pay attention to the signs
Seem like the blind following the blind
Thinking 'bout everything that's going on
I boost security up at my home
I'm with my kind if they right or they wrong
I call him now, he'll pick up the phone
And it's five in the morning, he waking up on it
Tell 'em wherever I'm at, then they comin'
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us
While they go home at night, that shit messed up
Knowing we needed help, they neglect us
Wondering who gon' make them respect us
I can see in your eye that you fed up
Fuck around, got my shot, I won't let up
They know that we a problem together
They know that we can storm any weather

It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

Fuck it, I'm goin' on the front line
He gon' bust your ass if you come past that gun line
You know when the storm go away, then the sun shine
You gotta put your head in the game when it's crunch time
I want all my sons to grow up to be monsters
I want all my daughters to show out in public
Seems like we losing our country
But we gotta stand up for something, so this what it comes to
Every video I see on my conscience
I got power, now I gotta say somethin'
Corrupted police been the problem where I'm from
But I'd be lying if I said it was all of them
I ain't do this for the trend, I don't follow them
Altercations with the law, had a lot of them
People speaking for the people, I'm proud of them
Stick together, we can get it up out of them
I can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope, but I'm telling my youngins to vote
I did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope, I was forced to just jump in and go
This bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change
Got time to be serious, no time for no games
We ain't takin' no more, let us go from them chains
God bless they souls, every one of them names

It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

They trainin' officers to kill us, then shootin' protestors with these rubber bullets
They regular people, I know that they feel it
These scars too deep to heal us
What happened to COVID? Nobody remember
It ain't makin' sense, I'm just here to vent
It happen to one of your people, it's different
We get it, the system is wicked, just learn how to pick it
Knowledge is power, I swear I'm a witness, I know that I'm gifted
I won't go too deep 'cause I'm scared they'll get me
Ain't scared to admit it, some shit I can't mention
It's people who can, well, here's the chance
I won't take the stand, but I'll take a stand for what I believe
Must not be breathing the air that I breathe
You know that the way that I bleed, you can bleed
I never been a fan of police
But my neighborhood know I try to keep peace
So it's only right that I get in the streets
March for a reason, not just on GP
Our people died for us to be free
Fuck do you mean? This was a dream
Now we got the power that we need to have
They don't want us with it and that's why they mad, yeah

It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear

Она хочет Вуу ниггера

Она хочет трахаться с Вуу
Она хочет трахаться с Вуу
Она хочет трахаться с Вуу
Она хочет трахаться с Вуу
Да, да, да, да

Я сказал ей, "Уух-вуу-вуу"
Шоути хочет трахнуть меня внутри купе
Я могу вывезти тебя хоть куда, нахуй реактивный тариф
Отель Versace на мне Versace халат, воу, воу
Люблю тебя, когда ты распускаешь свои волосы без расчёски
И  я остаюсь для себя, потому что я никогда не любил этих шлюх (Да)
И она любит только деньги, красный свет этим шлюхам
Почему я должен тратить своё время на шоути, у которой я не на переднем плане?
Особенно, когда ты получаешь дизайнерскую одежду и я пою вином и угощаю обедом
И Bentley пришёл с крыльями, как номер девять, да
Прохожу внутрь, только мы вдвоём
Ты нравишься мне, потому что ты режешь, как я режу
Прохожу внутрь, только мы вдвоём
Ты нравишься мне, потому что ты режешь, как я режу

Она хочет трахаться с Вуу (Эй, она хочет трахаться с Вуу, Вуу)
Она хочет трахаться с Вуу
Она хочет трахаться с Вуу
Она хочет трахаться с Вуу
Да, да, да, да

Это мой тип сук, она говорит немного дерьма
Как, "Когда ты полетишь ко мне наедине, могу я приземлиться на этот член?"
Она сказала, "Трюки для детей", она не влюбляется в трюки
Она может обращаться с собой самостоятельно, ей просто нужен член
Получил эту большую Birkin сумку стоимостью пять, шесть чисел
Ты может был не в своей лиге, ты можешь купить это, нигга? (Купи это)
Я подхожу к её вершине ухожу на рассвете, я дон
Ты можешь валять дурака, если хочешь, если хочешь
На Бали, большие качели, большое платье
Большая жопа, заставляю её сквиртить и делать большую грязь
До того, как мы закончили, она спросила "Где мы займёмся этим в следующий раз?"
Дальше, так мокро, что испортили сиденья в самолёте
Ей нравится всё это гангста дерьмо
Сверху вниз, катаюсь вокруг со стволом
С кем ты?Вуу
Ей нравится всё это гангста дерьмо
Я сказал, "Ей нравится всё это гангста дерьмо"

Она хочет трахаться с Вуу
Она хочет трахаться с Вуу
Она хочет трахаться с Вуу
Она хочет трахаться с Вуу (Хахаха)

Позволь мне взять тебя в магазин сладостей (Магазин сладостей)
Покажу тебе всё, что у меня есть (Всё, что у меня есть, всё, что у меня есть)
Повешу бриллианты на твою цепь (Цепь, ах)
Чтобы соответствовать твоему бриллиантовому кольцу (Ах, ах, ах)
Я 092, нигга, Вуу (Вуу, назад)
Ненавидишь это или любишь это (Ах, ах), это мы с тобой (Вуу)
Давай превратим её во что-то
Она сказала, что любит Вуу ниггеров (Вуу, ах)
Тех ниггеров, которые нажмут на курок (Гррт, ох, не, не, не)
Я был в порядке, когда встретил тебя (Встретил тебя, пау)
Затем я трахнул тебя (Вуу)
Затем я оставил тебя (Ах)
Потому что твоя киска чувствовала себя безумной (Безумной, чувствовала безумной)
И у меня не было времени, которое можно потратить (Нет времени, которое можно потратить, давай получим это)

Она хочет трахаться с Вуу
Она хочет трахаться с Вуу
Она хочет трахаться с Вуу
Она хочет трахаться с Вуу
Да, да, да, да

Pop Smoke, they know I'm wildin'
If I'm on the island, I'm snatchin' the cell
Brody got locked, denied his bail
Until he free, I'm raisin' hell
Tell my shooters call me FaceTime
For all the times we had to face time
Free D-Nice, he doin' state time

Please don't come out your mouth, you know I'm like that
I'll make a movie like TNT
Glock-30 on me, ask who really want it

(Mudanças de humor)
Oh, você não sabia que eu poderia cantar? (Oh, oh, oh)
Hahaha (Yeah)

A baixinha é uma vilãzinha (Ela é uma vilãzinha)
A baixinha é o meu amorzinho (Papo de beleza)
E a baixinha é rabuda
A baixinha tá tendo mudanças de humor
Toda vez que eu transo sem camisinha
Eu gozo nos cobertores
E eu mantive isso em segredo
Porque eu não beijo e digo (Beijo e digo)

Toda vez que eu transo, ela me chama de papai
Minha mina é safada
Eu vejo a buceta através da calcinha (O que você quiser)
Ela tem um sabor doce
Ela é uma rainha, tipo a Nefertiti
Uh oh, minha mina senta gostoso
E nós vamos fazer compras pela cidade (Oh, oh)
Eu dei as chaves do Bentley pra ela (Woah, woah)
Não fique de joelhos, você não precisa chorar por mim
Eu sou seu melhor amigo, baby, você não precisa mentir
Eu vou te dar tudo que você quer e precisa da Chanel à Celine
Cabe a você decidir
Valentino, yeah, eu te coloco no melhor
Começo a levantar seu vestido, começo a beijar seu pescoço (Oh não, não)
Começo a esfregar na sua bunda, começo a massagear seus seios
Eu não quero te dar um bebê ainda, então eu evitei e gozei nos seus seios
Eu coloco você em um Uber (Uber) e te mando pra sua cama (Oh)
No dia seguinte (Oh), você me enviou uma mensagem (Oh)
Você veio pra minha casa e nós fizemos de novo (Oh, oh)

A baixinha é uma vilãzinha (Ela é uma vilãzinha)
A baixinha é o meu amorzinho (Papo de beleza)
E a baixinha é rabuda
A baixinha tá tendo mudanças de humor
Toda vez que eu transo sem camisinha
Eu gozo nos cobertores
E eu mantive isso em segredo
Porque eu não beijo e digo (Ooh)

Você sabe, eu nunca encontrei um amor até que olhei em seus olhos (Até que olhei em seus olhos)
Tímido pela primeira vez, eu nem vou mentir (Nem vou mentir)
Quatro rounds seguidos, deixando hematomas nas suas coxas
Você a única vadia que poderia me fazer ser melhor que os caras
E a única vadia que me faz querer gozar quando tô dentro
É a sua vibe, saia comigo, você tá ficando chapado
Garota, não tem nenhuma vadia mexendo com você, mesmo que elas tentassem
Ela é um tsunami, eu nunca senti isso seco
Fecho meus olhos enquanto durmo, espero que você esteja lá quando eu acordar
Honestamente, eu sinto que a vibe que temos é ótima
E se houver algo na sua cabeça, você pode me dizer
E se eu te contasse o que tá na minha, você me ajudaria?
Você vai ver a situação inteira, só vai levar um tempo
Só porque você é minha, eu vou te manter sempre linda
Não existe imperfeições, garota, você é demais
Baby, qual é o seu signo?
Eu espero que você não seja contra o trabalho lento
(Trabalhe, trabalhe, sou eu e você) Eu e você
Fique em silêncio, não existe nada que não possamos fazer
Através da tempestade, baby, nós podemos superar
Por que você tá agindo se fosse nova? Você se conhece, minha gata, yeah
Subiu na minha Birkin, tá funcionando
Ela disse que é virgem (Tá doendo)
Ela é a minha maior fã, ela tá sempre à espreita
E ela sabe que eu sou um homem, vou colocar pra trabalhar
Eu sei que ela não pode me aguentar, sou chique
Então eu vou trazê-la quando eu conseguir o meu Grammy
Sexo tarde da noite, ela não consegue encontrar a calcinha
Não consegui segurar, agora ela precisa de um plano B

A baixinha é uma vilãzinha
A baixinha é o meu amorzinho
E a baixinha é rabuda (A baixinha é rabuda)
A baixinha tá tendo mudanças de humor
Toda vez que eu transo sem camisinha
Eu gozo nos cobertores
E eu mantive isso em segredo
Porque eu não beijo e digo

My name is Devvon Terrell
This is a raw session
You know the vibes

Trips that you plan for the next whole week
Bands too long for a nigga so cheap
And your flex OD, and your sex OD
You got it, girl, you got it (Oh)
Oh lemme tell you
You got it, girl, you got it
You should deal with a five star nigga
Know you work more than just 6 figures
I'm applying the pressure my finger on the trigger
I know you got a roster just full of hittas
But you need a first line up like Kawhi to the Clippers
Been through so much shit that you don't even know the difference
Made so many mental notes that you can't save a picture
Got so many cuts and bruises I was still invested
Still treat you like the best like KD to the Nets

I see you and I know you legit (Yeah)
High off you, I need a fix (Yeah)
You a hot girl I'm off this lukewarm
That's like comparing you to a groupon chile

You got it, girl, you got it (Aye)
You got it, girl, you got it

<|EndOfSong|>

You always wearin' them glasses
You don't wanna let no sucker look you in your eyes, huh?
Better show off them eyelashes
You love what you do with a passion
Ooh, that shit attractive
I fuck with you, girl

All he wanna do is gas me
How we end up in the backseat?
Just tryna get to the bag
We on the same page, you the same way
Only keep the fam around me
So let me know what it's gon' be
I don't plan on gettin' no sleep, while we

Doin' our thing, movin' too fast
Candy paint with the windows all black
Seats crème brûlée, what they gon' say?
With the top down screamin', "Money ain't a thing"
And we up 'til six in the mornin'
When the sun rise, we be on it
Ooh, I got five, you know it's all live
Tell me when to go, baby, when we gon' slide?
Baby, when we gon' slide? Hey, hey
Up all night, baby, when we gon' slide? Oh, yeah, yeah
Baby when we gon' slide, slide, slide, slide?
Slide, uh

I don't care if we on the run
Nothin' matters when we one on one
Lookin' at us 'cause we goin' dumb
We on the same wave, you the same way
You know I be down if it's with you
Where we goin'? Baby, what's the move?
We should take a trip up to the moon
Get a room

Doin' our thing, movin' too fast
Candy paint with the windows all black
Seats crème brûlée, what they gon' say?
With the top down screamin', "Money ain't a thing"
And we up 'til six in the mornin'
When the sun rise, we be on it

I'm on a mission, but we far out
This city talkin' with a large mouth
Yeah, they after the boy like Fall Out (4Hunnid)
Drop it, give me fifty, girl, drop it, give me fifty
You should slide with me 'cause you be trippin' when you miss me
You gon' hold me close and on your neck gon' be a hickie
I ain't gotta do too much, I know what get you sticky
I ain't gotta know astrology, I know your vibe
Skip the foreplay, you don't let niggas fuck with your mind
I ain't givin' out apologies when I'm behind
Fuckin' up the seats of the brand new ride

Doin' our thing, movin' too fast

Like the way she work, ayy
She always puts me first, ayy
And I know I've been around
But I swear you got the best on Earth, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, I got drip on the floor and it's gettin' nasty
He ain't keepin' his hands up off my asscheeks
I got somethin' to give him and if he asks me
I'm not fillin' up, baby, I let him gas me

Yeah
Her ass fatter than fat and she got good throat
Sit that cat on my lap, I give it good strokes
I might have to fly her out to Mykonos
Or maybe to Japan so I can hit her like I'm Ichiro
She knows what the fuck is up, I don't gotta dumb it down
Tatted like Rihanna, pussy singing like it's Run The Town
I love her, she's a freak
I promise if I could, I'd fuck her seven days a week
Face from the Middle East, ass from the West Indies
Suckin' the soul up out of my body, rest in peace
Head got me wobblin'
She know I got cameras, she say, "We should vlog it"
I know she got stamina, she said, "Start joggin'," yeah

Like the way she work, ayy
She always puts me first, ayy
And I know I've been around
But I swear you got the best on Earth, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, I got drip on the floor and it's gettin' nasty
He ain't keepin' his hands up off my asscheeks
I got somethin' to give him and if he asks me (Uh)
I'm not fillin' up, baby, I let him gas me (Uh)

Light me up (Light me up), light me up
I done seen the whole world and ain't no one as hot as us
Bankrolls, dank rolled, they ain't really as loud as us
I be hopin' that it's love, but it really just be the lust
Anything for a rush now, it's Van Nuys on the touchdown
It's a cold world, get a bust down
How you get my mind before my body and my trust now?
He say life is too short and he think that we should fuck now
I think I'm finna break him, it's gon' be quick
He know I ride that dick 'til I get seasick
Wavy lil' bitch to talk that East shit
Nasty, but don't put nothin' past me
Now I got the pussy and the power if you ask me

Like the way she work, ayy
She always puts me first, ayy
And I know I've been around
But I swear you got the best on Earth, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, I got drip on the floor and it's gettin' nasty
He ain't keepin' his hands up off my asscheeks
I got somethin' to give him and if he asks me
I'm not fillin' up, baby, I let him gas me

(Turn me up, YC)

Huh? (What?)
Ah, I thought a broke nigga said somethin' (Ah)
Talkin' shit, but they still ain't sayin' nothin' (Ain't sayin' nothin')
We gon' trap this bitch out 'til the feds come (Run it up, run it up)
Huh? (What she say?)
Ah, I thought a pussy ho said somethin' (Ah)
How it goes, when I'm talkin, you listen (Just listen)
Cut her off 'cause she spoke on the business (Go)

Hundreds and fifties, can't swap a dime for a penny
You know that's a stupid decision (Yup)
Headfirst with it
I shot a shot at my nigga bitch, really didn't think before I did it (No)
Make it make sense (Please)
Luckily, I was on point with the last ho, kept my receipts (Why?)
Warranty good, made sure I got a full refund when I gave her back to the streets (Go)
Forever I rep, put the set on the chain
I'm thuggin', you already know how I came (Know how)
Yeah, he got money, but niggas be lame
I Lambo'd her life, told her, "Get out that Range"
Her mani and pedi same color as my teeth (White)
She got a blue check and a check without me (Nice)
Hood nigga ridin' in a foreign on E (Still)
Sick of these niggas, COVID-19 (Ugh)
Karate’d the wock, he tryna kick the cup  (Shake it)
Came up like Giannis, I get bigger bucks (Made it)
Got four different choppers, right there in this truck (Now)
I'm just being honest, I could get you touched (Brr)
Put you in the blender, I could get you slushed (Haha)
I see the comments but really unbothered
I know it's hurtin', she salty, I scarred her
Beware what you lay up and say to these bitches, they can't hold water (Period)

Ah, I thought a broke nigga said somethin' (Ah)
Talkin' shit, but they still ain't sayin' nothin' (Ain't sayin' nothin')
We gon' trap this bitch out 'til the feds come (Run it up, run it up)
Huh? (What she say?)
Ah, I thought a pussy ho said somethin' (Ah)
How it goes, when I'm talkin, you listen (Just listen)
Cut her off 'cause she spoke on the business (Go)

I thought a nigga who watch what I do
But he can't get his bitch back said somethin' (Tough)
Is it true that he postin' another nigga money?
Probably, I don't put that past him (Maybe so)
I thought a ho that be speakin' on me
But be fuckin' a broke nigga said somethin' (Listen)
Hol' up, lil' bitch, get a nigga that's lit
I'm the whole loaf, he the breadcrumbs (Go)
Rappers with their mixed feelings (What?)
I ain't fuckin' with 'em (Nope)
Like a Richard Mille, let me know what time it is
Bagg, where the Runtz at? (Huh?) Know you got it on you '
'Posed to be smell-proof, bussin' out the vacuum seal
These niggas lil' boys, childish, Fisher Price
Confident, I'm not cocky, so get it right
She bendin' over, but I want some head first
I don't even wanna know what the pussy like
Trippin' too close to fallin', so I'm ballin'
It's crazy, my opp got shot but I ain't call it (Sike, slow up)
I come around, niggas gon' put they ho up
These bitches stay on my channel, yeah
Must've seen me on TV, yeah
It took me six hours to count a mil' exactly, I'm accurate with the cheese, yeah (Big Bagg)

Huh? (What?)
Ah, I thought a broke nigga said somethin' (Ah)
Talkin' shit, but they still ain't sayin' nothin' (Ain't sayin' nothin')
We gon' trap this bitch out 'til the feds come (Run it up, run it up)
Huh? (What she say?)
Ah, I thought a pussy ho said somethin' (Ah)

Ooh, ooh, no, no
NLE the Top Shotta

Uh, posted (Posted), in front of the trap (Front the trap)
Selling dope 'til the sun come down (Come down)
Take a fuck nigga right off the map (Off the map)
When I hit him with this whole hundred rounds (A hundred rounds)
Yung Joc, in the club with my Glock (With my Glock)
You want to play, and then this bitch going down (It's goin' down)
We ain't hesitatin', bullets get to blazin' (Get to blazin')
I'ma lay him down like he in the lounge
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down

Walk down on 'em in Balenciaga runners
My blood slime a nigga out just like an anaconda
You go against me, then you fucked just like a used condom (You fucked, yeah)
I roll 'em up and then I smoke 'em like some good ganja, ayy (I smoke 'em up, yeah)
Still doing drive-bys, but I wanna walk 'em (I wanna)
If I can't find 'em, you know I'm gonna stalk 'em (I gotta stalk 'em)
Caution tape up on the scene, I had to white chalk 'em (Grrt, grrt)
Running from my gun, but my bullets had to hawk 'em (Yeah)

Walk 'em down, walk 'em down
Walk 'em down, walk 'em down

Nigga, I was posted on the corner where the J's at
Roll up in the four by four, pull up at the corner store
And I got red in my drink when I pour up soda
I remember prayin' that the feds never take the Motorola
Choppa got the chopper, make 'em do a backflip
Pay my dawg a dime to walk him down, he need the racks, bitch
I been drinkin', I been taking all this codeine to the face
Got a lot of M's in the safe
Caught a murder, then I beat the case
I was just about to do the race

Uh, posted (Posted), in front of the trap (Front the trap)

Ouais, m'cassant à l'ouest (S'casser), vendant à l'ouest (Ouais)
Couteau métallique en or, j'peux te planter à l'ouest (Ouais)
Je viens de mettre un chargeur sur un nouveau Kel-Tec (Sur un)
Je viens de mettre mon sperme dans sa chatte, maintenant elle est mouillée

J'avais l'habitude d'aller au fond du bus (Ouais), maintenant j'saute dans un jet (Ouais)
J'avais l'habitude de dire à cette p'tite go : "C'est nous", puis de me lasser
Je l'appréciais bien avant, mais maintenant je l'aime
La façon dont elle boit mon crachat
Ta salope te trompe, elle est sous ma couverture, on fait des câlins et tout

Maintenant, ma belle dit qu'elle veut sucer le bout
C'est mon délire, bébé, je veux tes quatre lèvres (Mon délire)
Ex-camarade de classe, elle peut enfoncer un bateau
J'mange la molly et j'vais tripper cette salope
Ouais, ma belle, ouais, chérie, ouais, mon bébé, suce mes parties
Ferme les yeux, c'est juste toi et moi et personne
Ouais, suce-le sur le côté, qu'on soit en public ou sur la route (Hey)
Des sensations dans cette pute (Wouh), des sensations sur un jet (Wouh)
Cinq mille liasses, ouh
C'est une vraie bad girl, sa bouche envoie fort
Elle sait qu'elle a eu un déclic
Avec une chatte en bouche d'incendie (Hey)

Ouais, m'cassant à l'ouest (S'casser), vendant à l'ouest (Ouais)
Couteau métallique en or, j'peux te planter à l'ouest (Ouais)
Je viens de mettre un chargeur sur un nouveau Kel-Tec (Sur un)
Je viens de mettre mon sperme dans sa chatte, maintenant elle est mouillée

C'est en haut, c'est coincé (Ouais)
T'as cru qu'tu pouvais t'faire le gang, à quoi tu pensais ? (Gang)
Coupé rouge, le bruit des montagnes russes
Ces jours-ci, j'équilibre toute la haine avec de l'amour
Ces jours-ci, je verse toute ma douleur dans un verre (Glou glou)
Rêveur, c'est qu'un effet secondaire quand tu es avec nous (Le jeu)
Du calme, les gars sont juste derrière moi, ils sont sur les nerfs
Crois-moi, on sort en ville pour amasser (Ouh)
Des sensations dans cette salope, ils sont surpris que je sois encore en vie (C'est lourd)
J'ai testé, j'peux pas m'faire tuer, testé neuf fois mais j'suis Stilts
J'monte dans la caisse pour être bien à fond
Aqua dans la caisse, t'as capté (Ouh)

Ouais, m'cassant à l'ouest (S'casser), vendant à l'ouest (Ouais)
Couteau métallique en or, j'peux te planter à l'ouest (Ouais)

D-D-Daytrip took it to ten (Hey)

Ayy, Panini, don't you be a meanie
Thought you wanted me to go up
Why you tryna keep me teeny? I
It's a dream, he wished it on a genie
I got fans finally, ain't you wanting them to see me? I

I thought you want this for my life, for my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive, you lied

Just say to me what you want from me
Just say to me what you want from me

Ayy, Panini, don't you be a meanie
Thought you wanted me to go up
Why you tryna keep me teeny now?
Now they need me, number one on streaming
Oh yeah, you used to love me
So what happened, what's the meaning? I

I thought you want this for my life, for my life
Said you wanted to see me thrive, you lied

Now when it's all done, I get the upper hand
I need a big Benz, not another fan
But I still want you as a fan
I'ma need to sit down, don't mean to make demands
But I need you to...

Say to me what you want from me
Just say to me what you want from me

We've been on a tragedy for months
Why can't you agree with me for once?
Maybe we can be on chill tonight
Maybe I can give you chills too
We've been on a tragedy for months
Why can't you agree with me for once? Yeah
Maybe we can be on chill tonight (One time)
Maybe I can give you chills too (Chill)

I'm gettin' mine like fine wine measured in time
Many other brothers loved you but this pleasure is mine
It's no pressure for us to say that I love you for now
So fuck that cuffin' shit, I just want us be comfortable now, for real
Who you lovin'? Who you wanna pull up with?
Who don't care who you dated long as you care and you trustin'?
I'm tryna hear all your problems so I can lighten the load
No, you not fighting alone 'cause I'm protectin' you from 'em, so chill
Life hard and ex-lovers is like scars
'Cause it stop hurtin' but never forgettin' what it was
I was a youngin, my biggest enemy was the club
With voicemails on third rings fucking me up
So I don't trust

We've been on a tragedy for months (So I don't trust)
Why can't you agree with me for once? (And I'm tryna slow up)
Maybe we can be on chill tonight
Maybe I can give you chills too
We've been on a tragedy for months
Why can't you agree with me for once? Yeah
Maybe we can be on chill tonight
Maybe I can give you chills too (Hey, shawty, look, okay)

They switch up on you, I'm gonna stay the same, yeah
I pull up on you then put it in with patience
I'm good, well we got it without no expectation
What good is a title when shawty been that wave? Yeah
Let me illustrate you, let my tongue repaint you
It's already waxed, have you had a brainstorm?
Everywhere a nigga take you, just know that my face good
Modify your energy so your bank and your skin glow
Maxfield, let it fly, I be up in there a lot
Just to show I don't care, gon' wear it to that nigga house
We don't share our whereabouts or the gossip the hood love
Just supreme confidence, if we good that's good enough, woah, yeah

We've been on a tragedy for months
Why can't you agree with me for once?
Maybe we can be on chill tonight
Maybe I can give you chills too
We've been on a tragedy for months
Why can't you agree with me for once? Yeah
Maybe we can be on chill tonight
Maybe I can give you chills too

How 'bout that? Oh
I'm tired of makin' up and fallin' out
Wanna be the nigga you callin' up
To pick your body up when you down and out, let's chill
How 'bout that? Oh
I'm tired of makin' up and fallin' out
Wanna be the nigga you callin' up
To pick your body up when you down and out, let's chill

We've been on a tragedy for months

Okay, all my checks, I just be clearin' it
She suck my dick 'til she get delirious (Wow)
Okay, jump on the jet, so I'm Clearin' it (Woo)
Okay, 'Port, but I'm not talking New' (Let's go)
Okay, smoke that boy just like a cigarette
If that boy try to make a false move, uh (Damn)

I'm on some whole other shit
I got a whole 'nother rich, I'm on a new level
I was fucking on your bitch
She was ridin' on my dick, she ain't need two pedals
I swear these niggas, they bitches

Niggas, they mad about this
Niggas, they mad about that, but it's only if you let 'em
She save my name in her phone
Only thing she save me under is probably that "U" letter (Hello?)
No, I don't got provolone
Only thing in my pocket is probably, um, some blue cheddar
She tried to leave me alone
Then she got right with my clone, man, I hope that she do better
I know it's blue cheese on me
But when I got fifties on me, I call that shit loose cheddar (Hah)
Jeremy Scotts all on my feet

I am the richest nigga in my city
I can make it rain like no matter what's the weather (Facts)

Okay, smoke that boy just like a cigarette
If that boy try to make a false move (Lil Uzi)

They try to cut me down when they say I'm too low, woah, uh (Turn me up)
I said, "Turn me up," I cannot hear my flow, woah, woah

Do what I want, I'ma bend your rules (Woah)
I'ma take the dub, I'ma win
I ain't ever been no type that lose, yeah
Born like this, I ain't did no study
Everything I got, man, I got it in a hurry
If I love you, better say that you love me
And if I trust you, better say that you trust me
Talk 'bout the bag, the mula, the guap
I'm at the bank, only time that I'm runnin'
I said I'm on the road, no, I cannot stop
I'm runnin' through obstacles, I'm in a hurry
Woah, stop that
Told a fuck nigga just drop that (Yeah)
If you shoot first, we gon' pop back
Margiela on me, lil' nigga, that's not that
What you got on? Prada sweatsuit made of nylon
See my righteous girl, yeah, she say, "Right on"
When I hit that girl right with the light on
When I hit that girl, oh

Gotta shoot two at her
Ayy, gotta shoot two at her (Woah)
Ayy, stay with the blue cheddar (Woah)

Smokin' weed, you know I'm gettin' high, you know it calm my nerves
Trappin' hard, pumpin' non-stop, the bag I had to earn
You can try, but you might fail again, you know you never learn

Came in with a bottle, I was trippin'
And I took a couple shots and now I'm dizzy
It got me burning up, burning up
Insides burning up, burning up (Yeah)

Okay, I pull up, hop out at the after party

Anytime you live (Uh) out in the ghetto (Yeah)
You try to duck the feds (Uh), they need to let go

Came in with a bottle, I was trippin'
And I took a couple shots, it got me dizzy
It got me burning up, burning up
Insides burning up, burning up (Yeah)

Eu sou um problema, ser rico não é minha culpa
Você decide com quem você acha que essa merda mora
Eu estive quieto, difícil sentir minha falta quando eu estou voando
Saindo para Caicos, ela pode ficar no meu quarto
Ela pode ficar no meu quarto e não é meu
Eu estava tentando jogar direito
Eu estava tentando te tratar bem
Engraçado como eu tive que parar
Me vê quando estou saindo
Nós não tínhamos um problema
Então você foi e encontrou um
Como você vai conseguir uma bolsa?
Ela não consegue deixar de se apegar
Me vê quando estou fora
Me vê no lado sul
Eu percebo que você está doente por dentro
Porque ela só quer me amar, ela não quer me deixar
Ela só quer me amar, ela não quer me deixar

Pull up with a stick, I pull up with a stick (Mike WiLL Made-It)

I put some diamonds on her toes, let that ho know that I'm rich
We was used to pullin' kick doors (That money go for Myles)

I've been gettin' it since a toddler, I keep dollars on my head
Bein' a real one is my motto, handle my problems, I ain't scared
I put Prada on my collar 'cause she proud of what I said
I'm a leader, I got 'em followin' my footsteps like the feds
I shoot like I'm Montana, chopper bullets make 'em shed, uh
Black on black new Phantom, in the backseat sippin' red, uh
Bitch, I'm from Atlanta where these hoes ride the dick like peg, yeah
Condo like the pharmacy, I got codeine in my fridge, pour up

My bro on a steamin' stove, cookin' crack like grits
Got this vibe on her tippy toes, strokin' her in a pent'
LA live, I'm stayin' at the Loews with this Hollywood bitch
Got a nine and a snubnose (Let's go), can't wait to let it hit (Hit)
Pull up with a stick, I'll pull up with a stick
I'll pull up with a pink toe, I'm whippin', she suckin' this dick
I'll put some diamonds on her toes, let that ho know that I'm rich (Let that ho know that I'm rich)
We was used to pullin' kick doors, you could still call it a lick (Lick)
You broke and can't be fixed (Nah), went to Neimans and spent a nick (Hah)
How you poor? That don't make sense (Ah), I made a whole mile off an inch (An inch)
I had ninety-nine problems, I just scratched your ho off the list (Scratched your ho off the list)
Got some millions and went and solved 'em, now my neck cost a quarter brick (Brick)

I've been gettin' it since a toddler, I keep dollars on my head

Bestie, bestie, I just hit my friend
Told her "Catch me" (Woah), "Catch me" (Woah), I'ma lick her skin
She so precious, precious, might not fuck again
She too messy, messy, but hittin', no flexin' (No flexin')
Rose gold ornaments (Rose)
Dropped the two tint, car came with no tint (Damn)
You don't gotta use the door, you can hop in front of tip
Bond 9 in the vent, think 'bout dyin' and get spent
I got two B's on my boxers and a thottie in the bed (Yeah)
I know niggas ran up a milli', still didn't tell 12 shit (12, 12, 12, shh)
I got skeletons in my closets (Woah), and they scared of me and shit (Closets and they scared)
Maison Margielas under the bed screamin', "Rock me, kid" (Woah)
I put water on my head, then she got seasick (I put water on my head)
Couple opps played dead (What?), and they still got hit
I done bent lil' mama's spine but that still ain't my kid (Still ain't my kid)
Only reason I answer my line (Why?), is 'cause she drink my spit (No cap)

If you claim you want me, it ain't no thang
You acting kind of shady
You ain't been calling me baby, oh
Boy, you can go'n stop playing games
Playing games

I know you sayin', "Hit my line"
I'm on your mind, and that
You want this bad
So I'm cool with that
I'm just tryna match your words with your actions
I need more than satisfaction
Is you really 'bout that action?
Really want to give your all
But flex in front of your friends
How that work?
Swear that you doing the most
But we take a picture, can't post it
How that work?
Quit your talking, back that shit up
Won't you say my, say my

So won't you say my name, say my name?
If you claim you want me, it ain't no thang
You acting kind of shady
You ain't been calling me baby, oh
Boy, you can go'n stop playing games
Playing games

Games, games
Games, oh, games
We got London on the track

A las 2:30, cariño, ¿nos reuniremos en The Bean?
Si es muy temprano, tal vez más tarde podrías mostrarme algunas cosas
Sabes a lo que me refiero, cada vez que visito
La ciudad Windy, ella me da besos, no
Con treinta grados hace demasiado frío, así que abrázame fuerte
¿Te veré en el concierto esta noche?
¿Te veré en el concierto esta noche?

Ey, del camión al avión, al camión
Del camión al pasillo del hotel
Yo paseo por garajes subterráneos
Con un suite presidencial en el depósito
Y un ascensor hasta la habitación
Nos duchamos y luego vamos al club
Llego y tengo que ver qué ocurre
Con el código de área de mi teléfono
¿Qué números sigo teniendo?
¿A quién conozco del pasado?
Hablo con una, y ella dice que tiene un hombre
Hablo con otra, aparece verde
Debe haber cambiado de teléfono al equipo
¿Recuerdas cuando me llevabas por el buen camino?
Eso fue en 2017
Todo está bien, Chubbs mirará alrededor
Encuentra a alguien que sea de mi tipo
Ese es mi socio y él sabe lo que me gusta
Él encontró mucho en mi vida
El problema es que me veré con una chica esta noche
Y la trataré demasiado bien
Pasos de tarjetas de crédito en el Galleria
Sin siquiera saber si está casada

Pero sí sé una cosa
Las mujeres vienen y van
De sábado a domingo, y lunes
De lunes a domingo
Tal vez te amaré algún día
Tal vez algún día maduremos
Hasta entonces me sentaré borracho en esa pista
De un solo camino

A las 2:30, cariño, ¿nos reuniremos en The Bean?
Si es muy temprano, tal vez más tarde podrías mostrarme algunas cosas
Sabes a lo que me refiero, cada vez que visito
La ciudad Windy, ella me da besos, no
Con treinta grados hace demasiado frío, así que abrázame fuerte
¿Te veré en el concierto esta noche?
¿Te veré en el concierto esta noche?

Hay joyas en la caja fuerte a la llegada
J lleva una pistola para sobrevivir
Mucha gente lucha por el título
Mucha gente trata de aprovecharse
Pero yo sólo estoy tratando de pasar una buena noche
El camarero trajo el cheque de la comida
Ella dijo, "Cariño, creo que hubo un error"
No, chica, yo lo pago, no es nada
Podría mostrarte cosas más grandes que eso
En un minuto regreso
Déjame mostrarte imágenes que sí duran
AMEX tenía un límite en el pasado
Tuve muchas mujeres en el pasado
Pequé mucho en el pasado
No necesitas saberlo, pero puedes preguntar
Apegada a tu pase tras bastidores
Tienes todo el acceso porque eres mala
Podrías ir a donde sea con ese culo
Del concierto a la ducha, al camión
Del camión al club, para la fiesta
Entras primero con tus amigas
Porque no sé quién está afuera mirando

Pero sí sé una cosa
Las mujeres vienen y van
De sábado a domingo, y lunes
De lunes a domingo
Tal vez te amaré algún día
Tal vez algún día maduremos
Hasta entonces me sentaré borracho en esa pista
De un solo camino

A las 2:30, cariño, ¿nos reuniremos en The Bean?

Always get caught up in love, but I am done with that
I can't get caught up in love, so now I'm—, yeah
Flexin' on my exes, in my Model X
Pretty little skinny, little bitty body model-esque
Some of y'all ain't never had no real bitch and it shows
I keep it one hunnid from my head down to my toes
Back up on my bullshit
Back up on the move
Touch down in my hometown, got nothing to lose
I am on my own now, I am in control now
I need you to go now, I can fix my own crown

Back up on my bullshit
Back up on the scene
Done dealing with you
Don't know how to deal with me
Done fuckin' with you, don't know how to love me
Done dealing with you, so I'm back, yeah (Bitch)

Seen you with your ex, I see you still about your old ways
Might just see him for the weekend, you say that's a cold play
I be feelin' triggered, I don't know how to let it go
Really you ain't shit and I know I'm too emotional, hey (Hey)
Puttin' me through it
He's the only thing that's been gettin' me through it
He be comin' through with it
And I hope you cool with it

Doin' me
Back up on some new shit, everything in between

You know the truth is that these niggas is useless

Wheezy outta here

Yeah, rest in peace to Bankroll‚ show 'em how to do it
Baby goin' crazy‚ he been gettin' straight to it
I done caught so many flights I end up fuckin' all the stewardesses
Catch me in Atlanta‚ no security with my jewelry
Found I was rich, my baby mama talkin' suin' me
'Nother bitch tellin' lies on the pussy like she screwin' me
Catch him down bad, that's his ass‚ nigga, you or me
SI diamonds on the chain, he ain't foolin' me
We was skippin' school on the train‚ duckin' truancy
My main partner turned into a rat, he talkin' 'bout robbin' me
I pray the judge give that boy a bond so I can pop him
We was in the hood, sellin' bags, shootin' choppers
Fucked around and tried to go and lease a helicopter
Baby really a problem, somebody gotta stop him
And the haters watchin' too hard, I think they got binoculars
Every nigga with me on go, it ain't no stoppin' us
Niggas actin' like they got the bag, I'm tryna stop it up
Do this for the bros down the road, gotta lock it up
All you gotta do is say it's smoke, then we're poppin' up
Baby got the streets on hold, he ain't drop yet
I've been goin' hard, it's gon' be hard for you to top that
I make it look easy, but this shit really a process
I'm really a millionaire, still in the projects

Baby puttin' on for the city
Baby, he the realest, Baby prolly got a couple million
Baby hang with four or five killers
Baby got children, Baby prolly still drug dealin
Baby ain't a trapper, he a rapper
Baby makin' classics, Baby in the hood gettin' active
Baby keep it real with his people
Baby like a preacher, Baby prolly still sell reefer

Huh? Baby prolly still got them 'bows
I tell my bitch I'm faithful, but I still got the hoes
Baby gettin' jiggy, on stage with the Glizzy
Baby CEO, he shake the game like he Diddy
You would think it's Mardi Gras, I got these bitches showin' titties
And I ain't throwin' beads, I pull them bitches' weaves
I'm stallin' bitches out, if I'm a dog, then she a flea
And when I fuck her doggystyle the only time I'm on my knee
I barely wanna hit her, got her beggin', "Baby, please"
I tell a bitch to shut up, you 'bout to fuck my nut up
The label's CEO keep beggin' me to keep the gun up
They know, you play with Baby, Baby beat him, cut up
Private plane, Wi-Fi, on the FaceTime with Johnny
I told him ice my wrist up, I like to hold my fist up
How that boy DaBaby in the air not gettin' his dick sucked?
Why he keep the fire and throw them fours in every picture?
'Cause nigga...

Baby puttin' on for the city
Baby, he the realest, Baby prolly got a couple million
Baby hang with four or five killers
Baby got children, Baby prolly still drug dealin
Baby ain't a trapper, he a rapper
Baby makin' classics, Baby in the hood gettin' active
Baby keep it real with his people
Baby like a preacher, Baby prolly still sell reefer

These ain't no Guess jeans
I dropped out of school, I'm still good at math, but, nigga, don't test me
I played to the left, they went to the right, they tried to finesse me
Still riding 'round with that blicky, I hope they don't catch me
Police had raided our spot, so we went to the next street
Play like I'm dumb, as soon as it pop, I'm goin' retarded
He say I'm hard and he say I'm garbage, I'm rich regardless
We in Miami in the middle of the winter, and we on them jet skis
If we in Atlanta, I'm runnin' the 'Cat and I'm workin' the red key

I cannot mention my homies inside of my song 'cause I know they be trappin' a lot
I can't keep takin' these pills, when I'm in the trenches, they say I be cappin' a lot
I know a nigga who say he got rich off the dope, but I know he be actin' a lot
I know some niggas who said that they took down the city, but niggas be lackin' a lot
Yeah
That shit was awful, nigga had that dog food
That day they shot you, I slid on a Mongoose
You cannot come back around me, you turned your back on me, I cannot forget
The police was lyin', they say that they caught you, but nigga, they made you admit
Your name was found, you put in that work, they took your stick, you a bitch
Fuck my opps, they be on my dick, they all be mad we rich (Turn up)

Only twenty-five, livin' like a boss, ridin' 'round with a chauffeur
I don't sell drugs, still be paranoid, keep lookin' over my shoulder
Niggas lyin' like I'm stealin' swag, boy, that's my shit like I wrote it

Uh
These rappers really nice as hell
I'm a different nigga when I'm pissed off
Man, he say he gon' press up on who?
I'ma get the steel like I'm Chris Paul
Back to back suburbans, I'm a big dawg
I was in the slums servin' Fentanyl
Zombieland, junkies havin' withdrawals
I been gettin' to it, lotta missed calls
Turn it off, what the fuck is he talking 'bout?
I should slap you for sayin' he hot as me
I don't know who could fuck with me honestly
They know I'm the man, so they watchin' me
Different color bands like Monopoly
Man, he must not be usin' his head
If he thinkin' I don't keep a Glock with me
That's like suicide if you play with us
Got a better chance at the lottery
Call an ambulance when that chopper sweep
Make the crowd dance, choreography
Once I got a plan, ain't no stoppin' me
Three-car garage, million-dollar crib
With a foreign bitch ridin' on top of me
Lot of people done said I wouldn't be shit
Well, I guess they owe me an apology

These ain't no Guess jeans
I dropped out of school, I'm still good at math, but, nigga, don't test me
I played to the left, they went to the right, they tried to finesse me
Still riding 'round with that blicky, I hope they don't catch me

Tell them niggas I say fuck 'em
These hoes ain't shit, they want my cash, so I'll never love ’em (Stupid bitch)
I flash and beat a nigga ass with this fifty ball (I don't need no clique)
On TV, I could tell my youngin hit him with the cutter (Motherfuck a nigga)
That's a bar, real nigga blessed him with that bar and he say yeah-eah
He out the H, you play, he shoot you in your face (Northside)
Bullets flying, back to back, bitch, when we ride
I'm convicted, but it's an issue, I'll slide for a slide
Die today, bitch, they say four pussy niggas died 'fore I died, slime

I feel like I'm Gucci Mane in 2006
All these diamonds dancing on my fucking neck cost like four bricks
And the way that I be toting on that strap don't make no sense
He a million dollar nigga but be posted in the bricks, uh
It make no sense, yeah, it make no sense, uh
It make no sense, goddamn, make no sense, yeah, uh

Make no sense, nah, it make no sense, slime

And yo ass be looking so fat when it be in them tights
And I'm going straight to the top, so hope you ain't afraid of heights
You always keep me right, for a fact, you never left
Through all the trials and tribulations, always had my best
So here's fifty-five hunnid, go and get your breasts
Start rubbin' on your butt, start kissing on yo neck

Don't rush, slow touch
Brown and white, like I go cunch
Grab and buy, make 'em go bust (Buss)
Eye for eye, make 'em lose trust
White rum, fizzy pop (Pop)
Where you dey go? (go) We dey go up
Catch my vibe (Vibe), let me go off (Off)
Blammed her twice, man it's so tough

Aight yo, put the Belaire on her batty, make it kotch
Seen the watch, now she wanna give crotch
Boy got ps, now she hopping in the pod
Man in real life sugar, gyaldem haffi get wopped (Yeah)
Know she want dark, told her "Meet me at the top"
Switching lanes the other day, I seen her waiting for a bus
Baby this a Moncler sweater, Diesel denim
Buy another while my pockets fat like Heather
Neck froze like I don't know no better
Benzo truck, white seats and they leather
Go broke never, on my grind
She make it clap like I'm Busta Rhymes
I got the juice, the sauce and all them things
I blammed her twice tonight with all my bling
Big Benz, I drive, I brought that ting
Any girl you want, they want my ting

Don't rush, slow touch
Brown and white, like I go cunch
Grab and buy, make 'em go bust (Buss)
Eye for eye, make 'em lose trust
White rum, fizzy pop (Pop)
Where you dey go? (go) We dey go up
Catch my vibe (Vibe), let me go off (Off)
Blammed her twice, man it's so tough

Flood my ice, make a ho blush
Back at the tour bus, gettin' caught up
DSquared got 'em distressed, gotta hand wash
New racks with the old Nikes in the shoe box
Keep my stripes, no cuffs
Pull up in a new plate and she might just
She weren't tryna move bait when our eyes locked
New tints on the coupé, that's her head lost
Off my whites, right my wrongs
Gucci my mum, while you diddle your thumbs
Count my sums, this is gonna get long
Love my green, I'm tryna get strong
Tryna get bun, where I'm from, it's on
Yes, man don't take no dumb, threats
They see funds, they hop, fence
We been up, not up next

Don't rush, slow touch
Brown and white, like I go cunch
Grab and buy, make 'em go bust (Buss)
Eye for eye, make 'em lose trust
White rum, fizzy pop (Pop)
Where you dey go? (go) We dey go up
Catch my vibe (Vibe), let me go off (Off)
Blammed her twice, man it's so tough

And introducing
The one and only

Big truck, no clutch (Clutch)
Wrist froze, don't touch
French Ciri, I'm so drunk (Turnt)
Course I can't drink and drive, where's my chauffeur?
Bando upsuh, whip that coca
I really hope this time my worker don't floss
See, I was in the wok, now my penthouse at the top
Shawty said they're best friends, I bet they both fuck
'Cause they won't cuss, 'cause they said I sold drugs
And when you down there, ain't nobody around
Where's the comeback? When you blow up
I forgot my jacket but my heated seats help me warm up
Fast train to Inverurie, I used to go up
It's ironic, I just sold out my show in Scotland
Used to say I wanna put Tottenham on the map
But one day I'ma change the map in Tottenham

Don't rush, slow touch
Brown and white, like I go cunch
Grab and buy, make 'em go bust (Buss)
Eye for eye, make 'em lose trust
White rum, fizzy pop (Pop)
Where you dey go? (go) We dey go up
Catch my vibe (Vibe), let me go off (Off)
Blammed her twice, man it's so tough

Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm

Natural born hustler, nigga, stuntin' is my strong suit
Flexin' with a hundred cash, look at what these songs do
Gangster and a baller, baby, I do what I want to
I be with some steppers, I don't care 'bout what you gon' do
Wet shit like the Warriors, all my niggas gon' shoot
He gon' have to take a loss, some my niggas gone too
I know a bad bitch and I'm who she belong to
I just picked a Cuban up from Wafi, bitch, these stones new

Dolce & Gabbanas on my feet and these my favorite pair
Got a lot to lose, still can't be scared to take it there
I was in them slums, shit get dreadful like some Haitian hair
I come from that zoo, it's just cobras, pigs, and apes in there
1300 block, bitch, I caught my last cases there
Ain't no second chances in this shit, so we can't play it fair
Foenem line shit like a barber, Glock knock off his facial hair
Caught him lackin' in his whip, they tryna find his face in there
Lil Hop Out, he stay on go, bitch, all he know is green light
Let off shots with accuracy, showed 'em what that beam like
Posted by that liquor store, was sellin' what the fiends like
Used to wake up in low income, now I live a dream life

Natural born hustler, nigga, stuntin' is my strong suit
Flexin' with a hundred cash, look at what these songs do
Gangster and a baller, baby, I do what I want to
I be with some steppers, I don't care 'bout what you gon' do
Wet shit like the Warriors, all my niggas gon' shoot
He gon' have to take a loss, some my niggas gone too
I know a bad bitch and I'm who she belong to
I just picked a Cuban up from Wafi, bitch, these stones new

Bury me like a pharaoh with this money and my gold too
Keep a shooter in there, try to rob me, this the wrong tomb
I hit Johnny Dang and mixed the diamonds with the gold tooth
The FN sing a song like it's the leader of a soul group
Don't come 'round here like we friends, you know I don't know you
You know I got demons, allow me to show you
Lately, I been on the road (Yeah), show after show
I know I'm makin' all the opps mad back home
Been a while since I had to dial from a trap phone
See you later, alligator, quite a while, crocodile, we gone
Pray to God that my money stay long
Also prayin' for good aim for when the devil try to go

Natural born hustler, nigga, stuntin' is my strong suit
Flexin' with a hundred cash, look at what these songs do
Gangster and a baller, baby, I do what I want to
I be with some steppers, I don't care 'bout what you gon' do
Wet shit like the Warriors, all my niggas gon' shoot
He gon' have to take a loss, some my niggas gone too
I know a bad bitch and I'm who she belong to

She used to work at King of Diamonds on a Monday
Only hit the club on Saturday and Sunday
I used to pull up every week, you should've seen her
The way she did it, nobody could do it cleaner
I seen her in the suit for my birthday
And I can tell you the reason these niggas thirsty
Lil' mama getting it in all on her worst day
Lil' mama getting it in, she fit the school and the gym into her workday
I'm sprung, she got me doing the dishes
Held a nigga down when the clip was to an extension
You so bad, yeah, you so vicious
I'm so glad that you not his chick
She wanted a nigga and got the right one
I wanted to bag, she lookin' like fun
Pull up on me, baby, and spend the night, ah
They sayin' I'm sprung, they right

I can't let you go without me
Ayy, shawty got me (Ooh)
Wait, now lil' mama tryna lock me (Ooh)
It can't be nobody if it's not me (Ooh)
I'm in the same spot that you dropped me
I can't let you go without me
Ayy, shawty got me
Wait, now lil' mama tryna lock me (Ooh)
It can't be nobody if it's not me (Ooh)
I'm in the same spot that you dropped me
You, you, do, do, do
You sprung me, baby, I sprung you too
Too, too, too, too, too
You undone me, baby, I'ma undo
You, you, do, do, do
I like a bust it baby, I'ma buss' you too
You do too, too, too
I'm sprung and it's true, 'cause

Ooh, you did it, ooh, did it, you
I already know what it takes to get into you
Ooh, bring it back
She put that pussy on me, she know how to make it clap, make it clap
I make it clap, yo, I make it clap, yo
I have them haters asking, "How you up in that Rolls?"
And how them umbrellas coming out of locked doors?
How the front doors open up like the back doors?
I'll be like, "You ain't rich enough
You ain't got my bitch in a Lamborghini, bikini, on the beach sittin' up"
Now you bitching up, now your bitch with us
She said, "That champagne nasty," spit it up
Tory took one line and made a hot song
Now the chicks want tapes, I am not gone
But it's been five times, you ain't catch on
Maybe on the next song

I can't let you go without me
Ayy, shawty got me (Ooh)
Wait, now lil' mama tryna lock me (Ooh)
It can't be nobody if it's not me (Ooh)
I'm in the same spot that you dropped me
I can't let you go without me
Ayy, shawty got me
Wait, now lil' mama tryna lock me (Ooh)
It can't be nobody if it's not me (Ooh)
I'm in the same spot that you dropped me
You, you, do, do, do
You sprung me, baby, I sprung you too
Too, too, too, too, too
You undone me, baby, I'ma undo
You, you, do, do, do
I like a bust it baby, I'ma buss' you too
You do too, too, too
I'm sprung and it's true, 'cause

I'm sprung, dawg she got me
Got me doing things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm telling you
I'm sprung, dawg she got me
Got me doing things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm telling you

You're so sexy to me
Sexy to me
Give a damn who your ex be
I be flyin' to you jet speed
You sexy
Make me wanna get messy
Make me wanna give it to you all day, all night
In the broad light, give a damn who catch me
You sexy
Sprung, girl, you get me
Got me doing things I never do
And it's true

I got a brand new Draco with me
Clip got thirty-three, Scottie Pippen
Bitch nigga ain't heard of me, I got a Richard
Drippin', my sweatsuit Givenchy
I brought my strap in the party
And my diamonds offset like Cardi
Got a bad bitch with me, she a Barbie, huh
You don't wanna start with me

Got some hood niggas postin' in Le Jardin
I have his nigga on back of a carton
Spend Larry Bird, thirty-three on Cartier
I got thirty-three bitches with me
I'ma float through the city sippin' on some chardonnay
Fuck it, I'ma buy it out the bar today
Fuck it, I'm buying out Barney's, yay
I'ma hang with the gangbangers
He only hang with the feds and the rats and the mice
If my young nigga pull up with the bullets
I'ma pull up with the strap, we gon' get him on sight
We gon' make a thriller like Mike
Car candy painted, Mike and Ike
And my diamonds lookin' like a light
I'ma fly a private like a kite
Got the Bentley coupe in China white

I been done ride through another nigga city
I got a brand new Draco with me
Clip got thirty-three, Scottie Pippen
Bitch nigga ain't heard of me, I got a Richard
Drippin', my sweatsuit Givenchy

No, you don't wanna start with me (No, you don't wanna start with me)
Niggas pull up with Glock, AK's and TEC's (Uh-huh)
Runnin' up your whole block like a full court press
No, you don't wanna start with me (No, you don't wanna start with me)
No, you don't wanna start with me (No, you don't wanna start with me)
I know cold-hearted demons, they can smell your flesh (Uh-huh)
Walk up on a pussy nigga, shoot him dead in the chest
No, you don't wanna start with me (Nah)
Made a lot of plays, hood got J's
I kept me a bag with some hard in it (Hard in it)
Rappin', made a name
Now I get paid for a stage, I keep a guitar with me ('Tar with me)
Executive, ayy, black President Escalade
Bulletproof with a bar in it (Bar in it)
Go against it, it gon' be a hard ending (Hard ending)
I fucked and left, I hope it ain't no hard feelings (Nah)
Was broke as fuck, that's how I started drug dealin' (Drug)
Get some millions, it'll make a nigga love livin'
Andrew Jackson, my lil' niece and nephew love twenties
Me and Roddy got a get it out the mud business
Made a hundred racks on a C-day
Made a million dollars on a weekday
Fifteen thousand on a cheap day
Whippin' up dope like a deep dish
Junkies outside, no rebates

Bitch nigga ain't heard of me, I got a Richard

Cacti, não é chá gelado (Ah)
Uh, deixei eles confusos tipo Spike Lee (Ah)
Você precisa de mais que o Google pra me achar (Ah)
Eu acabei de chamar a minha mina, pra ela ficar loka (Ah, ooh)
Incrível, no no geral
Eu comecei a gravadora só pra me assinar
Uh, eu e Chase conectados como siameses
Soltamos tanta coisa, me senti numa onda de crimes
Fala comigo de boa, eu vi o rosto dele, vi isso, sim, na camisa branca dele, uh (Vamos)

Sim, sim, chama o pessoal da Sprite (Chama eles, peraí)
Voo privado pra França, tentando ver em panorama (Voos privados)
Atirei nas mãos dele, ele estava digitando (Da, da, da)
Ferrari Caterpillar, eu dobro e levanto (Pra cima)
Eu fui para o depoimento, mandei o juiz me passar minha taça (Ayy)
Arrecadei vinte milhões, disse pro diabo manter a sorte
Deixo, deixo a vadia, descanse em paz, Pop, deixo a fumaça (Ayy, slatt)
Ayy, fala comigo de boa (Fala comigo de boa, slatt)
Deixo ela na corrente, sim, eles gostam de mim (Sim, gostam de mim)
Scotts sem cordas, não pode me amarrar (Com o, peraí)

Dá licença, si-si-si-si-si-si-si, não falte, cara
Mississippi, molhe um canudinho,deixe eles felizes, deixe eles copiarem
Faça eles quererem fumar comigo (Sim),é muito o que eu tenho pra gastar
Me fala quando precisar que eu puxe, você vai atirar enquanto eu giro
Viajando como se estivesse feliz no gatilho, peixe salgado, ackee, ackee
Carrinho de golfe, Kawasaki, pesque um peixe, Sushi Maki, viva a vida
Em Londres, saia da cidade (Ah)
Thug e Travis são a tropa, sim, você sabe disso (Parça)
E quando eles nos libertarem, será um filme, um Kodak (Sim)
Atire em mim derramando bem acima da borda como  o Pollack
Eu tava rasgando e correndo, não escorregando ou deslizando, tendências atléticas
Eu tava cozinhando isso, batendo na rocha base, eu forneço o remédio (Vamos lá)
Quando abrimos os portões da Utopia (É quente), é como Zootopia
Você vê as cruzes sobre você (Sim), é assim que você sabe que somos nós
Às quatro da manhã estou te ligando, não para esfregar o ombro
Os Jackboys abrem os limpadores do jeito que eles dobram

Sim, de camisa branca (Yeah)
Sim, chama o Hype Williams para o hype, por favor
Sim, eles vão sumir com você antes de você me matar
Sim, abrindo meus cheques, não meus ...
Cheques, não meus...

Eu-Eu estou onde a luz está
Bangers no sistema, é...
Bangers no sistema, é...
É o antigo Anunnaki
Bangers no sistema, é isso...
Bangers no sistema, é isso...
M.I.A.!

My heart so cold I think I'm done with ice (Uh, brr)
Said if I leave her, she gon' die
Well, bitch, you done with life (Okay)
Better not pull up with no knife
'Cause I bring guns to fights (Boom)
Say you got that sack, I got that sack
But ain't no ones in mine (Nope)
And my lil' bitch say I'm gettin' too bougie

What I look like with all them twenties? (Huh?)
Know them hoes like how I'm coming (Yeah)
What I look like with all this money? (Huh?)
How I look havin' all these hoes? (Uh)
When I crack a smile, white gold (Bling)
Yeah, I'm talkin' diamonds, froze (Yeah)
Came from the bottom, toes (Woah, Kenny)

Yeah, backend Baby (A hundred)
That's what they pay me a show (Let's go)
That's probably some cap in my rap
By the time this shit drop, they gon' pay me some more (Uh-huh)
And I still can go back to the trap
Send a box, pick it up, make a play at the store
Feelings still hurt from when I saved that ho

My heart so cold I think I'm done with ice (Uh, brr)

Walk in the bank with a M in a tote (Yeah)
I'm tryna make a deposit
Let 'em try play with the money (Pow, pow)
Shawty gon' take off your noggin
Long as she want it and pick it, I'm buyin' it
I had the Rover for a year, I don't drive
I get 'em whacked, I don't advise 'em to try it, yeah
I'm runnin' shit, I ain't lyin'
I got a backend for one twenty-five
I bought a Patek for one eighty-five
This shit gettin' easy at this point

Heartless, don't need a valentine (Forever)
I call 'em racks, not bands (Why?)
Ain't no rubber band on mine (At all)
I used to be down, down, down, down
Waiting on taxes time (Fucked up)
Look at me now, now, now, now
They pay me to flex and shine (I'm up, let's get it)
Big speaker like an eighteen inch sub (Yeah)
I'm a hundred, you a dub (Nothin')
Lookin' for me, I'm booked up (Where you at?)
50 Cent, I'm in the club (Hey)
Diamonds on my earlobe, ice on dyke (Huh?)
One-fifty on studs
Rugrat, young nigga got it out the mud

My heart so cold I think I'm done with ice (Uh, brr, Big Bagg)
Said if I leave her, she gon' die

I could've sworn I went to sleep and she was right here
Don't know if I seen her in my dreams or my nightmares
Think it was my nightmares
And I think I need your love, I don't need no one selfish
Wonder if I give this girl my heart, could she help it?
And you know she's an angel if you let her tell it
Baby hot as hell, she got kicked out of heaven
You know I love them braces, them big lips, that red skin
You know I love the faces she make when we sexing
Can't get her off my mind if I tried, my obsession
Block both her numbers, erased all our texts, yeah

(Wheezy outta here)

I'm a late bloomer, third year on the scene
Twenty racks don't feel like nothin' to me
Came from the streets, it turned me to a beast
Invisible set, diamonds huggin' my piece
Book me for a show, I need eighty at least
I want the smoke, ain't no keepin' the peace
Keep me a razor when I'm in the East
Open 'em up just like a surgery
Everything burnin' around me, I'm lit
Show a lil' attitude, swap out the bitch
I spent two-fifty, don't know where it went
My hood on my back, I gotta represent
Toronto, you useless, you don't got a pole
Warm that boy up, he got shot in the cold
Thirty rounds in the clip, let it unload
I fuck the bitch I picked right out of Vogue

Took twenty bitches on my first vacay
I ain't pickin' up, I'm in Turks, lil' baby
Every other watch got diamonds in the face
Pullin' out, ask to take a taste, lil' baby
Pullin' out fifty racks, walkin' out of Chase
If I drop dead, I'll be hard to replace
Hardly get thirsty, got water like a lake
My brother got locked, another bond I gotta pay

Trappin' on the block, I'd never serve a cop
I always kept a Glock, I ain't 'bout to see the grave ('Bout to see the grave)
Pull up, I'll make a quick stop (Yeah)
I shop one stop, I'm high for seven days (High for seven days)
Who is that lil' nigga icy hoppin' out a Wraith? (Hoppin' out a Wraith?)
Chopper get it choppin' like a blade (Chop)
You ain't get no money but you poppin' on your page (Poppin' on your page)
Trust me, we could never be the same (Never be the same)
You know I like to flirt, no skirts in Turks (Yeah)
I'm puttin' in work, I beat her out the frame (Beat her out the frame, Wheezy outta here)
She sweet, I was movin' off a Perc'
I bought her a Birk' and a birthday cake (Birthday cake)
Line his ass up like a barber do the fade (Barber do the fade)
Fed your ho crêpes and grapes
Cash told me, "Wait, it's a billion on the way" (Billion on the way)
We just split a billi' with the gang

Took twenty bitches on my first vacay
I ain't pickin' up, I'm in Turks, lil' baby
Every other watch got diamonds in the face
Pullin' out, ask to take a taste, lil' baby
Pullin' out fifty racks, walkin' out of Chase
If I drop dead, I'll be hard to replace
Hardly get thirsty, got water like a lake
My brother got locked, another bond I gotta pay

First time in Turks, had a whole bunch of work
Had to bring two jets, had a whole lot of babes (Yeah)
I first take a game-changin' verse
Swear the change gon' hurt, but it really ain't a game (Yeah)
Shawty like to twerk, I bring the rage (Yeah)
Really get to trippin' on the stage
Never ever let 'em see the man unless they pay  (Alright)
Niggas havin' beef, I hope they pray
Cactus Jack me up and down, head to toe
Make sure the ones you with on go
Make sure the ones you with is with it
Make sure the ones you with, ah (Yeah)
She need a quick tan, come to Turks with the G's (Yeah)
Work for that body, need more than degrees
Fillin' her nose with some shit I can ski with
Say this her first time, it's hard to believe

Took twenty bitches on my first vacay

Hair done, nails done like a bad bitch
Broke niggas turned me to a savage
I can't fuck him if he average
Way more bad than your last bitch (Period)

A real hot girl know how to keep a nigga heated
You say you want respect, well, treat me how you wanna be treated
You told me keep it real, but you don't practice what you preachin'
You want me to blow your phone up and come a-lookin' for you 'til I find ya
You really want me to whoop the ho that you fuckin' with if I find her
Bitch, you ain't that busy, I don't give a fuck what you ain't got time for
You look me in my eyes and know you lying, man, that's fraud, bruh
Man, you knew I was a player 'fore you met me, need to relax
You know that you gon' hate me if I get to playin' get-back
I ain't turn into no bad bitch when you met me, boy, I been that

I got my mind on gettin' paid, we ain't spoke in some days
He probably thinkin' I'm in pain, but I'm really on game
Ain't no nigga finna stop me, independent, I got me
All the shit that I be needin', can't depend on a "probably"
And that's fucked up, 'cause you know that I don't fuck with nobody
I be quiet, but you out here tellin' stories, one-sided
I ain't perfect and I try to fix the shit that ain't workin'
But it's 2020, I ain't finna argue 'bout twerkin'
Since you wanna test them waters, might as well jump in with both feet
If you leave me and you see me, better act like you don't know me
If you think this shit get better with another bitch, go get her (Go and get her)
When you realize she ain't got you like I got you, I can't help ya

Took half a mil' for my lil' bro to get out
That new Richard Mille made me feel like a boss
Feel like I'm Meech when I'm ridin' in these cars
Who you know pull up whole entourage in a foreign?
I got designer for days, but it's somethin' about 'em
Go crazy for white Air Force 1's, maybe 'cause I'm a dope boy
He be loud, but he ain't makin' no noise
'Ventador on the ground like a skateboard
If I want it, I get it, I pay for it
I pay extra, I ain't tryna wait for it
Everything that I got, it was made for me
I was servin' them trap houses faithfully
Everybody with me gotta eat
Say your grace with me

Thou shall not try one of us, if they do, I'ma bust
Please don't reach for no chain
Not 'bout the set, but it's more 'bout respect
If they get me upset, they gon' die, that's on gang
Ran up my check, when I walk in the bank
They greet me at the door by my government name
I made a promise, I'm never gon' change
Rolls-Royce umbrella, I'm hopin' it rain, yeah

Right back on it, designer my garments
Corner store mornings, there until the sun down

Goin' number one now, hottest out, hands down
Bands out, pants down, yeah, I'm thuggin'
I done got rich, everybody my cousin
You ain't servin' no packs with me, you ain't my brother
That chopper go through shit, I call it the cutter
I just bought a new whip, I went bought another
My mother, she happy now
Ain't no cap and gown, but I graduated
Her house paid for, and that new Mercedes
Know you see that they been tryna be me lately
I'm a heavy hitter like Gervonta Davis
That shit ain't gon' save 'em, leave 'em on the pavement
All I know is get this motherfuckin' paper

Turn rat? Nigga, fuck on
Thirteen thou' VVS buffs on

Tryna get in her heart with no code
Tried leavin' the F-word alone
It ain't right how you usin' your tone, uh
Made young nigga, got mine, ain't runnin' off
Check out how I'm livin', I just went and got another house
Millions in the bank, got another million floatin' home
One point three each estate, add it up if you can't count
Quarter-million chain, quarter-million car (Wow)

G-Nine, Mister Two-Glocks, just bought a MAC (Oh yeah)
A MAC for your facelift, rearrange your cap (Come here)
One foot in the industry and one foot in the trap
Invite that dope to my bloodline, I treat him like my strap
'Cause 'bout me he'll take a nigga's feet off the map
Big B's 'til I'm sleep, push a P, he get clapped
Two guns, that's the twin Glocks, I roger that
My heart colder than a bitch 'cause the bitch froze at that
Like apostrophe, Google forgot a comma in the back
Say I'm worth 250K, we can bet a trey on that, nigga

What all do you want from me?
AR's and them .223's
Fuckin' 'round with me, you see
I'm hot, I'm 500 degrees
Heard he caught a body
But that does not mean shit to me
Got two on me, got two on me

Got pain in my heart
Mello made it right
I got pain in my heart, I told you a hundred times
Yeah

I got pain in my heart, I told you a hundred times
But it's money, money, money, money, money on my mind
Put a beam on the glizzy, don't get caught between the lines
Last nigga we got busy on got hit between the eyes
Roll my problems in a Backwood and put it in the sky
Got your mans in this Backwood, put it in the sky
I was taught to love my brothers and to hate the other side
Hate the other side, hate the other side

Bougie off the ecstasy, I might act rude, uh
I lost gang members, I can't act cool, uh
I got gang scriptures in my tattoos
I was runnin' from the police in my trap shoes
Posted, tryna flip a hundred, I couldn't buy food
Come from nothin', but I blossomed to a tycoon
Betrayal scars, can't stop thinkin' 'bout them stab wounds
We might not catch him today but he gon' die soon
I'm from Chicago, she said she like my accent
I'm from Chicago where Glocks what we react with
Standin' tall, make him tumble when that MAC spit
Bitch, I'm a gangster, I just took off on some rap shit (Off on some rap shit)

I got pain in my heart, I told you a hundred times
But it's money, money, money, money, money on my mind
Put a beam on the glizzy, don't get caught between the lines
Last nigga we got busy on got hit between the eyes
Roll my problems in a Backwood and put it in the sky
Got your mans in this Backwood, put it in the sky
I was taught to love my brothers and to hate the other side
Hate the other side (Yeah), hate the other side

Hate the other side (Side), hate the other side
Could give a fuck about a bitch, got too much money on my mind
Shit, I heard they was lookin' for me, I'm not hard to find
Everybody that I'm with got nothin' to lose, bitch, they gon' ride (Boom-boom-boom-boom)
Saw my uncle in the grave, that brought tears to my eyes
But I ain't gon lie, I done been through this shit too many times
My heart's still tryna recover from pain all my life
I really been to hell and back a couple hundred times
Couple hundred times, read between the lines
I'm still tryin', I'm still tryin' to get by (Get by)
I still got memories that lay deep inside
Creepin' up on my mind
It's fuckin' up my life

I got pain in my heart, I told you a hundred times
But it's money, money, money, money, money on my mind
Put a beam on the glizzy, don't get caught between the lines
Last nigga we got busy on got hit between the eyes
Roll my problems in a Backwood and put it in the sky
Got your mans in this Backwood, put it in the sky
I was taught to love my brothers and to hate the other side
Hate the other side, hate the other side (Side)

Solía tener amigos, ahora tengo enemigos (Uh)
Solía mantenerlos cerca, ahora están muertos para mí (Maldición)
Solía tener amigos, ahora tengo enemigos (Uh)
Enemigos, sí, es muy triste

Decían que no llegaría tan lejos, ah, ah
¿Piensan que no vemos quiénes son, son, son?
Riendo al banco como ja, ja, ja
Supongo que solo estoy hablando mucho, bla, bla, bla  (Cállate la puta boca)
Entonces, ¿a dónde fueron? (Uh)
Cuando estaba en bancarrota no podía ni comprar cigarrillos
Ahora tu mamá necesita boletos para mi concierto en el estadio (Concierto en el estado)
A ella le encanta cuando me escucha en la radio, oh
Sé que es difícil tragarse su orgullo
Me disculpo porque no puedes superarme (Superarme)
Ahora estás fuera de mi vida, estoy tan aliviado, yo

Solía tener amigos, ahora tengo enemigos (Maldición)
Solía mantenerlos cerca, ahora están muertos para mí (Uh)
Solía tener amigos, ahora tengo enemigos (Maldición)
Enemigos, sí, es muy triste

A veces, siempre, me decepcionan (Me decepcionan)
A veces, siempre, me decepcionan (Me decepcionan)
Solía tener amigos, ahora tengo enemigos
Enemigos, sí, es muy triste

Cerca de mis enemigos (Vamos)
Necesito mejor energía (¿Eh?)
Cuando te dije que te jodieras, pensaste que estaba jugando, ¿eh?
(Sí, sí) Pero lo decía literal
Ella quiere quedar, le dije a la mierda eso (No)
Ella me mira como si estuviera sorprendida
Empaquetan el correo y estoy solo en casa
Cuando la caja toca la puerta, van por 35
Trato de poner de mi parte para mis compañeros, se convierten en enemigos antes de que el ojo de un negro lo haga
Alcanzas un batido, voy a sostener un puño
Dándole a un negro un cuarto de libra sin las papas fritas
Acabo de conseguir doble platino sin colaboraciones
Sólo para mostrarle a un negro que en realidad no lo necesito
Pásale a un hombre un plato y puede hacerlo temblar
Está garantizado que se doblará y morderá la mano que lo alimenta
Y sé que piensas que no lo veo
Y sé que tu perra no tiene auto
Me estás obligando a que vaya y le compre un pequeño Prius
Follemos frente a la cámara, podemos llamarlo incluso
Los amigos son como el otoño, cada año se van
Y voy a rastrillarlos en una pila, tirarlos en una bolsa
Atarlos junto a sus perras y dejarlos
Porque la mayoría de estos negros son engañosos
Y yo (Uh)

Solía tener amigos, ahora tengo enemigos (Maldición)
Solía mantenerlos cerca, ahora están muertos para mí (Uh)
Solía tener amigos, ahora tengo enemigos (Maldición)
Enemigos, sí, es muy triste

A veces, siempre, me decepcionan (Me decepcionan)
A veces, siempre, me decepcionan (Me decepcionan)
Solía tener amigos, ahora tengo enemigos
Enemigos, sí, es muy triste

Es demasiado tarde para cambiar esta mierda (Demasiado tarde)
Solo me sostuviste cuando querías que me ahogara
Es demasiado tarde para cambiar esta mierda (Demasiado tarde)
Así que no intentes decirme que estás feliz por mí ahora

Solía tener amigos, ahora tengo enemigos
Solía mantenerlos cerca, ahora están muertos para mí
(Muertos para mí)
El dinero tiende a mostrar todas sus intenciones (Intenciones)
Enemigos, sí, es muy triste

A veces, siempre, me decepcionan (Me decepcionan)
A veces, siempre, me decepcionan (Me decepcionan)
Solía tener amigos, ahora tengo enemigos
Enemigos, sí, es muy triste

Uh, es demasiado tarde
Es demasiado tarde
