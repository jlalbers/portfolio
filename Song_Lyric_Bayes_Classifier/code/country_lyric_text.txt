I, I hope she makes you smile
The way you made me smile on the other end of a phone
In the middle of a highway driving alone
Oh baby, I, I hope you hear a song
That makes you sing along and gets you thinking 'bout her
Then the last several miles turn into a blur, yeah

I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

Yeah, babe, I hope she shows up in a 2 AM pic from her friend
Hanging on to a guy and you just ain't him
I hope you stay up all night all alone, waitin' by the phone
And then she calls
And baby, I, I hope you work it out
Forgive and just about forget
And take her on a first date again
And when you lean in for a kiss

I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

I hope what goes comes all the way around
I hope she makes you feel the same way about her
That I feel about you right now

I hope you're both feelin' sparks by the end of the drive
I hope you know she's the one by the end of the night
I hope you never ever felt more free
Tell your friends that you're so happy
I hope she comes along and wrecks every one of your plans
I hope you spend your last dime to put a rock on her hand
I hope she's wilder than your wildest dreams
She's everything you're ever gonna need
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me
And then I hope she cheats
Like you did on me

Like you did on me

We're in the homestretch of the hard times
We took a hard left, but we're alright
Yeah, life sure can try to put love through it, but
We built this right, so nothing's ever gonna move it

When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good

Call it dumb luck, but baby, you and I
Can't even mess it up, yeah, though we both tried
No, it don't always go the way we planned it
But the wolves came and went and we're still standing

When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain 'cause you and I remain the same
When there ain't a crack in the foundation
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good
When the bones are good

Bones are good, the rest, the rest don't matter (Baby, it don't really matter)
Paint could peel, the glass, the glass could shatter (Oh, the glass, oh, the glass could shatter)
Bones are good, the rest, the rest don't matter (Ooh)
Paint could peel, the glass, the glass could shatter (Yeah)

When the bones are good, the rest don't matter
Yeah, the paint could peel, the glass could shatter
Let it rain (Let it rain, let it rain)
'Cause you and I remain the same (Woo)
When there ain't a crack in the foundation (Woo)
Baby, I know any storm we're facing
Will blow right over while we stay put
The house don't fall when the bones are good

Yeah, ooh

Do you love the rain, does it make you dance
When you're drunk with your friends‚ÄÖat‚ÄÖa party?
What's your‚ÄÖfavorite song, does it make you‚ÄÖsmile?
Do you think of me?

When you close your eyes, tell me, what are you dreamin'?
Everything, I wanna know it all

I'd spend ten thousand hours and ten thousand more
Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours
And I might never get there, but I'm gonna try
If it's ten thousand hours or the rest of my life
I'm gonna love you (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)

Do you miss the road that you grew up on?
Did you get your middle name from your grandma?
When you think about your forever now, do you think of me?

When you close your eyes, tell me, what are you dreamin'?
Everything, I wanna know it all

I'd spend ten thousand hours and ten thousand more
Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours
And I might never get there, but I'm gonna try
If it's ten thousand hours or the rest of my life
I'm gonna love you (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'm gonna love you (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)

Ooh, want the good and the bad and everything in between
Ooh, gotta cure my curiosity
Ooh, yeah

I'd spend ten thousand hours and ten thousand more
Oh, if that's what it takes to learn that sweet heart of yours (Sweet heart of yours)
And I might never get there, but I'm gonna try (Yeah)
If it's ten thousand hours or the rest of my life
I'm gonna love you (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'm gonna love you (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh)
Yeah
And I...
Do you love the rain, does it make you dance?
I'm gonna love you (I'm gonna love you)
I'm gonna love you

We used to chase that Chattanooga freight
Couple of kids in a Chevrolet
Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple limb
Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now what I was doing then

Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasin' that freedom, chasing' that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasin' that you and me, I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasin' you, still chasin' you

You always used to talk about LA
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Well you know I tried to track you down
I only got as far as Guitar Town
Singing about a girl I used to know, used to know
Well you should know that I haven't given up
I'm just on your radio

Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasin' that freedom, chasin' that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasin' that you and me, I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasin' you, still chasin' you

Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasin' that freedom, chasin' that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasin' that you and me, I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasin' you, still chasin' you

Still chasin' you, still chasin' you

Been flyin' solo for so long
Nobody's singin' the harmony
Up there just me and my shadow
No bass, no guitar, no tambourine

And I found you like a melody
You were singin' in the same key as me
We had ‚Äòem dancin' in the streets

I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone, alone
Puttin' miles on a run-down van
Baby, we can take our own show on the road
I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune
We'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby, take my hand
I don't wanna be a one man band
No

I wanna run down your wild dreams
And I wanna chase every high with you
Count every rip in these old jeans
We'll never learn how to sing the blues

If I'm gonna be famous
Girl, I wanna be famous with you
We got our own little groove

I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone, alone
Puttin' miles on a run-down van
Baby, we can take our own show on the road
I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune
We'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby, take my hand
'Cause I don't wanna be a one man band

When the spotlight goes cold, and the curtains come down
The chairs are all stacked, and there's no one around
And nobody's payin', we‚Äôll still be playin'

I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a rolling stone, alone
Puttin' miles on a run-down van
Baby, we can take our own show on the road
I'll lay down the beat, you'll carry the tune
We'll get tattoos, and we'll trash hotel rooms
Baby, take my hand
'Cause I don't wanna be a one man band
I don't wanna be a one man band

She said, "Baby, do you ever miss bein' alone?"
I said, "Hell no, I don't"
She said,‚ÄÖ"Do‚ÄÖyou really think‚ÄÖI'm where you belong?"
I said, "You‚ÄÖknow and I know..."
You're perfect for me
Everything I'll ever need
I ain't playin'
What I'm sayin'

When I got what I got, I don't miss what I had
The old me before you belongs to the past
In the back of your mind, you might think there's somethin' more I want
But when I got what I got, girl, I don't

I said, "Baby, do you know you sound a little crazy
When you're talkin' like that, girl?"
Ain't no second thoughts, no regrets, no kinda maybe
No wishin' I turned back
Before you came along
I could go all alone
Girl, just kiss me
You're all that I want

When I got what I got, I don't miss what I had
The old me before you belongs to the past
In the back of your mind, you might think there's somethin' more I want
But when I got what I got, girl, I don't

She said, "Baby, do you ever miss bein' alone?"

No, I don't
No, I don't
When I got what I got, girl, I don't

Hey mama, how do you get a red wine stain
Out of your favorite dress?
Black mascara off a pillowcase?
Cure a one-too-many headache?
Mama, can I come and maybe stay a few days
This weekend or next?
And hey, how do you get a red wine stain
Out of your favorite dress?

How does he sleep at night?
Mama, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Mama, can you die from a broken heart?

Can you ask Daddy if he's got time
To come and look at my front door?
It got slammed last night
And now it don't close right
And just promise that you won't tell him everything
And keep that pistol in the drawer
Mama, please don't say
I'm gonna laugh about this someday
You didn't see the way he drove away

How does he sleep at night?
Mama, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Mama, can you die from a broken heart?
Oh, a broken heart

Can your knees give out from prayin' so hard? (Prayin' so hard)
Can you go blind from crying in the dark? (In the dark)
Was it ever really real
If he don't feel like I feel?

How does he sleep at night?
Mama, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
How does he sleep at night?
Mama, the nerve of this guy
To leave me so easy
Am I gonna be alright?
I wanna kick myself for falling so hard
Mama, can you die from a broken heart?
A broken heart

It's all on me, it's my mistake
I said "I don't love you" a little too‚ÄÖlate
But‚ÄÖI guess there‚ÄÖain't ever a right time
And I‚ÄÖdon't know why it's called a goodbye
Go run my name into the ground
Tell everyone you know just how
How I slammed the door on our forever
But I promise you it's for the better

I hope you find what you were looking for
I hope your heart ain't hurting anymore
And you get moving on, all figured out
And you don't hate me somehow
'Cause I hope you're happy now

Who knew this heart could break this hard
Or a love like ours could fall apart
Without so much as a warning
I thought that I was what you wanted

Well I guess you found what you were looking for
I guess my heart ain't worth it anymore
I'm a wreck, I'm a mess
And I ain't got nothing left
And so I hope you're happy now

I hope you find what you were looking for
I guess my heart ain't worth it anymore
Hope you get moving on, all figured out
And you don't hate me somehow
I'm a wreck, I'm a mess

So I hope you're happy now

Your song comes on and your eyes close, that's when I know, yeah
You got your heart on lock down, got a wall I gotta knock down
Kinda wanna do a shot now, come on now

And you're one of them girls that ain't tryna meet nobody
You're just here for the party, if I'm wrong then stop me, yeah
You're one of them girls that ain't handin' out your number
You like to make us want you, you like to make us wonder

If you're one of them girls, 'cause I'm one of them boys
Would trade his whole world, hm, yeah
For one of them girls who likes to act all quiet, sexy, not even tryin'
Yeah, you know I ain't lyin', damn right
You one of them girls, broke every heart in your hometown

Lettin' go a little, little by‚ÄÖlittle
Sippin'‚ÄÖon a frozen‚ÄÖdrink

Tiki bars tik'n, pourin' all weekend
Clouds‚ÄÖain't leakin' no rain
Two pieces shakin', white caps a-breakin'
We ain't feelin' no pain, it goes like

One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, shot
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow, leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down, we'll be on our way
One more barefoot round, one more last chance to say
"Hey, se√±orita, don't you think we need a salt and a Buffett song?"
One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, we'll be gone

Ice blue skies, shades on the eyes
To tuck the bloodshot away
Hair of the dog, shouldn't take long
But who cares, we got all day
Palm trees a-leanin', sunburn screamin'
But we'll all be alright, after

One margarita, two margarita, three margarita, shot
Don't worry 'bout tomorrow, leave all your sorrow out here on the floatin' dock
When that sun lays down, we'll be on our way
One more barefoot round, one more last chance to say

I smell your perfume in crowds
I swear your number's all my phone wants to call

It's kinda funny how I can't seem
To get away from you
It's almost like you don't want me to

You've got a cold heart and the cold hard truth
I got a bottle of whiskey, but I got no proof
That you showed up tonight
In that dress just to mess with my head
So much for so long
Out of sight, out of mind
Girl, you're lookin' so good
It's drivin' me out of mine
Oh, you're breakin' my heart
Baby, you're playin' hard to forget

Told me to leave all your things
Out on the porch, on the swing
You'd come and grab 'em by the end of the week
Well, it's just some jeans and a shirt
But it's a whole lot of hurt
I think I know why you've been dragging your feet

Ain't it funny how I can't seem
To get away from you?
It's almost like you don't want me to

You've got a cold heart and the cold hard truth
I got a bottle of whiskey, but I got no proof

And I‚ÄÖdon't‚ÄÖmean to pry,‚ÄÖbut girl, I gotta know
What is‚ÄÖyour name?
How come I ain't seen you around before? (Tell me)
You know I ain't ever had a type, having a type takes two
But I know what I like, and you're the only one of you
You're something else (Damn)
And I know we just met, but

I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks, to my old friends
To the house in the pines where the road ends
Take you to my hometown, where I grew up
Where I thought I knew it all before I knew what love was
Gave up on it, but honey, you got my hopes up
And I'm thinking that I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks

(I wanna take you home)
I wanna take you home, not just take you home tonight
Get Joanie on the phone, she'll leave us on a light
I wanna see the way you look up under all those stars, yeah
You're gonna be the talk, word's gonna get around
They'll tell you how they thought I'd never settle down
Out on the porch, ain't it funny the way things change?

I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks, to my old friends
To the house in the pines where the road ends
Take you to my hometown, where I grew up
Where I thought I knew it all before I knew what love was
Gave up on it, but honey, you got my hopes up
And I'm thinking that I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks

I wanna introduce you to my kinfolks, to my old friends
To the house in the pines where the road ends
Take you to my hometown, where I grew up

17 in a small town
Weak knees in a CVS
Door locked in the bathroom
What's it gonna‚ÄÖbe‚ÄÖwaitin' on that‚ÄÖtest?
Never thought that they'd be
Puttin' those‚ÄÖlife plans on the shelf
A couple American babies raisin' one up their self

One beer turns into a lit cigarette
Burnin' into a two beer buzz
Three beers turns into five and six
Then a love drunk kiss in the back of that truck
Just like that, everything rearranges
Life changes out of the blue
It's just a Bud Light, but ain't it funny
What one beer can turn into?

Crayon stick figure family
Stuck right there front center on the fridge
Flash back to two pink lines
A whole bunch of prayin' and doubtin'
Felt like the end of the world
Now the world don't spin without 'em (Hey, yeah)
Oh, 'cause

One beer turns into a lit cigarette
Burnin' into a two beer buzz
Three beers turns into five and six
Then a love drunk kiss in the back of that truck
(In the back of that truck)
Just like that, everything rearranges
Life changes out of the blue
It's just a Bud Light, but ain't it funny
What one beer can turn into?

A boy and a girl and a three on the tree
K-I-S-S-I-N-G
First comes lust, then the shotgun marriage
Six months later come a baby in a carriage
You know what, y'all? You know what, y'all?
The whole thing started with some alcohol
The whole thing started with some alcohol (Hey, yeah)

One beer turns into a lit cigarette
Burnin' into a two beer buzz (Into a two beer buzz)
Three beers turns into five and six
Then a love drunk kiss in the back of that truck
Just like that, everything rearranges
Life changes out of the blue
It's just a Bud Light, but ain't it funny
What one beer can turn into?

A boy and a girl and a three on the tree
K-I-S-S-I-N-G (Oh)
First comes lust, then the shotgun marriage
Six months later come a baby in a carriage
That's not all (Nah), that's not all (Nah)
Here we go again, drinkin' alcohol, yeah

Ooh
Ooh‚Ää

Yeah,‚Ää I'm a turner
I turn pages all the time
Don't like where I'm at
34‚Ää was bad, so I just turn to 35
Yeah,‚Ää I'm a keeper
I keep digging down for the deep
Like‚Ää the records I'm playing
They might keep you waiting
But you know I'm only playing for keeps

And if the house just keeps on winning
I‚Ää got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love keeps giving me lemons
I'll just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart

Ooh
Ooh

Well, I'm a giver
Yeah, and I'm still giving 'em hell
Forgiving's pretty hard
So I made an art out of forgettin' 'em well
Yeah, I'm a rhymer
I can turn 20 cents into a 10
And if I get confused and I start to lose
I rhyme a dime 'til it all makes sense

And if the house just keeps on winning
I got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love keeps giving me lemons
I'll just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I turn a light on in my soul
And keep a bluebird in my heart

Ooh
Ooh

And if the house just keeps on winning
I got a wildcard up my sleeve
And if love starts giving me lemons
Just mix 'em in my drink
And if the whole wide world stops singing
And all the stars go dark
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart
I'll keep a light on in my soul
Keep a bluebird in my heart
Keep a bluebird in my heart

Ooh
And the bluebird sings
Ooh

I was a third-string dreamer on a second-place team
But I was hell on wheels with‚ÄÖa‚ÄÖfull head of‚ÄÖsteam
When coach put me in
And I'm‚ÄÖstill proud of that hit
I was a last resort to go to prom with the queen
Thanks to an ex-boyfriend who broke her heart that week
No, I didn't get lucky
But I still felt like a king
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

I was the one phone call when my brother went to jail
Pawned my guitar just to pay his bail
No, I'll never get it back
But I'm okay with that
I was the first man standing next to my best friend
The day the love of his life said "I do" to him
I was a couple beers deep
But I still remembered that speech
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving, average Joe
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

There's a worn-out blade that my granddaddy gave me
My mama's first Bible, Daddy's Don Williams vinyl
That first-fish-catching Zebco thirty-three
Well, that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving average Joe (Average Joe)
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And I'm a damn hard working
One thing's for certain
I stand up for what I believe (For what I believe)
That might not mean much to you
But it does to me
Yeah, it does to me
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me

Oh, it does to me
Oh man, it does to me

Girl, our mamas are best friends and so are we
The whole town's rooting for us‚ÄÖlike‚ÄÖthe home team
Most‚ÄÖlikely to settle down
Plant a few‚ÄÖroots real deep and let 'em grow
But we can't stop this real world from spinnin' us
Your bright lights called, I don't blame you for pickin' up
Your big dream bags are all packed up and ready to go
But I just need you to know

That I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost souls 'round, and Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown

I ain't the runaway kind, I can't change that
My heart's stuck in these streets like the train tracks
City sky ain't the same black
Ain't that a map dot shame, man, to think that

I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost souls around, and Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown

Yeah, you got a wild in your eyes that I just wasn't born with
I'm a same gas station cup of coffee in the mornin'
I need a house on the hill, girl, not in 'em
So hang onto these words 'til them avenues help you forget 'em

'Cause I love you more than a California sunset
I love you more in a twenty-dollar sundress
Hate that loaded down car you got your keys in
Girl, but I hate even more that you're leavin'
'Cause I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But that ain't you and me so I guess I'll see you around
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown

Love you more than my hometown
Love you more than my hometown
Love you more, baby, love you more

Daddy, I'm afraid, won't you stay a little while?
Keep me safe 'cause there's monsters right outside
Daddy, please don't go, I don't wanna be alone
'Cause the second that you're gone they're gonna know
Before he went to bed he grabbed my hand and said

Just 'cause I'm leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, I know you're scared when I'm not here
But I'll always be right there
Even though I'm leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere

Dad, we'll be late, and Uncle Sam don't like to wait
He's got a big old plane that's gonna take me far away
I know I act tough, but there's a churnin' in my gut
'Cause I just can't call you up when things get rough
Before I left, he hugged my neck and said

Just 'cause you're leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, I know you're scared I might be here
But I'll always be right there
Even though you're leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere

Daddy, I'm afraid, won't you stay a little while?
I never thought I'd see the day I had to say goodbye
Daddy, please don't go, I can't do this on my own
There's no way that I can walk this road alone
Daddy grabbed my hand and said

Just 'cause I'm leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, boy, I ain't scared
I won't be here, but I'll always be right there
Even though I'm leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere
I ain't goin' nowhere

Don't get me wrong
I like a bobber on the water
Hookin' 'em and reelin' 'em in
I like a Friday night slow ride
Brooks & Dunn B-side
Hit rewind, spin it again
I like a strong shot of whiskey
The way a Marlboro hits me
Some broken in cowboy boots

But I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you, honey
You're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves
I'm in love and lovin' on you

I like a sunrise, duck blind
Birdie on a par 5
Miller Lite before noon
I like a two-door old Ford
Wood board back porch
Three chords and the truth

But I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you, honey
You're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves
I'm in love with lovin' on you

Girl, I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you, honey
You're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves
I'm in love and lovin' on you
I'm in love and lovin' on you

I can't wait to show you where I grew up
Walk you 'round the foothills of my town
Probably feel like you've been there before
After hearing all the stories I've been telling you
For six months now

We'll probably have to sleep in separate bedrooms
Pack a shirt for church, because we'll go
I'm not trying to scare you off, but
I just thought that we should talk
A few things out before we hit the road

If I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She falls in love a little faster than I do
And my dad will check your tires
Pour you whiskey over ice and
Take you fishin', but pretend that he don't like you
Oh, if we break up, I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine

My sister's gonna ask a million questions
Say anything she can to turn you red
And when you meet my high school friends
They'll buy you drinks and fill you in
On all the crazy nights I can't outlive

So if I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She falls in love a little faster than I do
And my dad will check your tires
Pour you whiskey over ice and
Buy you dinner, but pretend that he don't like you
Oh, if we break up, I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine

Oh
Mmh

If I bring you home to mama
I guess I'd better warn ya
She feels every heartache I go through
And if my dad sees me cryin'
He'll pour some whiskey over ice and
Tell a lie and say he never really liked you
Oh, if we break up I'll be fine
But you'll be breaking more hearts than mine
You'll be breaking more hearts than mine

I've been thinkin' 'bout ya lately
Reminiscin', goin' crazy
Miss the way your kiss would keep me‚ÄÖup
Ayy,‚ÄÖwish that you‚ÄÖwere here tonight
Drinkin' vodka soda, extra‚ÄÖlimes
And we could just get back to bein' us

'Cause I just wanna be cool again, cool again, cool again
Like we were last summer
Want you again, you again, you again
To be stealin' my covers
All tangled in each other, nights still playin' back in my head
I just wanna be cool again, cool again, cool again, yeah

Do you ever think about
The days we couldn't live without each other?
Where the hell did we go wrong?
Ayy, how'd we go from that to this?
How'd we let a good thing slip?
Do we really have to go move on?

I just wanna be cool again, cool again, cool again
Like we were last summer
Want you again, you again, you again
To be stealin' my covers
All tangled in each other, nights still playin' back in my head
I just wanna be cool again, cool again, cool again, yeah

Yeah, I just wanna be, cool again
(Cool again, cool again, cool again, cool again)

'Cause I just wanna be cool again, cool again, cool again

Want you again, you again, you again
To be stealin' my covers
All tangled in each other, nights still playin' back in my head
I just wanna be cool again, cool again, cool again, yeah

(Cool again, cool again, cool again)
Y'all know that I just wanna be cool again (Cool again, cool again, cool again)
Last summer with you (Cool again, cool again, cool again)
Cool again
(Cool again, cool again) Cool again, yeah

Dancin' in the kitchen, you singing my favorite songs
Swinging on the front porch, just laughing at the dogs
How you swear you love me more
When you're whisperin' goodnight
All those little moments are every reason why

I'm homesick
This feelin' that I'm feeling'
No, it don't quit
It's like half of me is missin'
Heaven knows it that all I wanna do
Is be alone with your brown eyes all tangled up
Just holdin' onto you tonight
Until the mornin'
Baby that's the damn truth
If home is where the heart is
Then I'm homesick for you

Well it says Kane Brown
On a sign with a line out the door
It sold out some little town
I've never been before
Yeah, they're screamin' my name
This is what we dreamed about
But out here singin' about you, baby, all I think about

Is how I'm homesick
This feelin' that I'm feelin'
No, it don't quit
It's like half of me is missin'
Heaven knows it that all I wanna do
Is be alone with your brown eyes all tangled up
Just holdin' onto you tonight
Until the morning
Baby that's the damn truth
If home is where the heart is
I'm homesick for you

Homesick for you
Yeah, yeah

I'm homesick
This feelin' that I'm feelin'
No, it don't quit
It's like half of me is missin'
Heaven knows it that all I wanna do
Is be alone with your brown eyes, just tangled up
Just holdin' onto you tonight

Out here, ain't nothin' but woods and water
Drop a beer from a stand, catch‚ÄÖa‚ÄÖfish with a‚ÄÖbobber
Drink a beer out the can,‚ÄÖliquor out the bottle
How the good Lord intended it
Yes, he did

I love my country, I love my country
Six strings and fiddles, whiskey from Kentucky
We keep it funky we like how it sounds
Monday to Sunday, yeah, I love my country
Up loud and proud, rollin' into town
Hanging out the window like a Bluetick hound
Ain't sorry, ain't nothin' to be sorry about
I love my country, I love my country up loud

Barbecue, steak fries, styrofoam, plate date night
George Strait, singing greats, while we turning up, sitting lake side
That pedal steel, she straight slidin' over here to me
She do that Alabama Shake, like you ain't ever seen

I love my country, I love my country
Six strings and fiddles, whiskey from Kentucky
We keep it funky, we like how it sounds
Monday to Sunday, yeah, I love my country
Up loud and proud, rollin' into town
Hanging out the window like a Bluetick hound
Ain't sorry, ain't nothin' to be sorry about
I love my country
I love my country up loud
I love my country up loud
I'm talking way up loud

I like pop, and rock, and rap, I like Skynyrd
And going out downtown when I'm with her
Like driving too fast down a four-lane road
But damn sure nowhere close to the way that

I love my country, I love my country
Six strings and fiddles, whiskey from Kentucky
We keep it funky, we like how it sounds
Monday to Sunday, yeah, I love my country
Up loud and proud, rollin' into town
Hanging out the window like a Bluetick hound
Ain't sorry, ain't nothin' to be sorry about
I love my country, I love my country up loud (Yeah, baby, ooh)
I love my country up loud, yeah, way up loud

When you do somebody wrong, make it right (Make it right)
Don't hide in the dark (Don't hide in the dark), you were born to shine
In a world full of hate, be a light

Yeah, it's hard to live in color
When you just see black and white
In a world full of hate, be a light

I probably shouldn't have said hello
When I saw you out with your friends
I know I should've left it alone
When I caught you looking

A little smile, a little how you been
A little touch, a little reminisce
It always starts off innocent

But after a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye, given up at two
If we didn't wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh, after a few

We always take it way too far
Where it's too much to resist
We always make it way too hard
To walk away after that third kiss

We pretend that we'll be fine
Through the sting of the morning light
'Cause it happens every time

After a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye, given up at two
If we didn't wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh yeah, after a few

Little smile, little how you been
Little touch, little reminisce
We both know how it ends

After a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye, given up at two
If we didn't wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh, after a few

You're all alone at a party, you wanna dance with somebody
But you ain't got a clue how to ask
You and your girl had a fight and now she's sayin' goodbye
She ran upstairs and packed her bags

It could be rainin' on your perfect vacation
You could be stressed about your work situation
Ain't gotta listen to me, but all I'm sayin'

Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix
Ain't no pain it can't wash away
From the moment that it hits your lips
Makes those clouds look a little less gray
Oh, you could be lonely, or heartbroken
Or hungover from the night before
Turn that frown into a smile real quick
There ain't nothing that a beer can't fix

You're on a lake and you're fishin'
It's hot and all that you're gettin' is a little nibble here and there
You're sitttin', watchin' your team losin' that championship ring
And you're feelin like life ain't fair

It could be rainin' on your perfect vacation
You could be stressed about your work situation

Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix
Ain't no pain, it can't wash away
From the moment that it hits your lips
Makes those clouds look a little less gray
Oh, you could be lonely, heartbroken
Or hungover from the night before
Turn that frown into a smile real quick
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix (Yeehaw)

It could be rainin' on your perfect vacation
You could be stressed about your work situation
Ain't gotta save it for no special occasion

Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix
Ain't no pain, it can't wash away, no
From the moment that it hits your lips
Makes those clouds look a little less gray
Oh, you could be lonely (Lonely)
Heartbroken (Heartbroken)
Or hungover from the night before
Turn that frown into a smile real quick (So quick)
It might take one or it might take six
Drink it down, it will do the trick
Ain't nothing that a beer can't fix

She walks up, velvet rope unhooks
She snaps her fingers and a drink comes
She locks you‚ÄÖdown‚ÄÖwith just one‚ÄÖlook
She's got this whole club undone
If‚ÄÖshe's on the rebound, you ain't gonna know it
Coming off a heartbreak, she ain't gonna show it
She's eyes caught, red dot, locked on me, yeah

She wants my hands on her body
She wants to burn like she's made of fire
Said she ain't going home 'til we
Drink every drop of Kentucky dry
Don't even know what she'll do when she does it
Palm of her hand, I'm hers in the blink of an eye
She don't take no and I love
She gets what she wants
And I get to be what she wants tonight
I get to be what she wants tonight

I get to catch all her secrets
Sequins bouncing off flashing lights
If she wants it, then we're leaving
Get me home, park the truck, cut the tires
I get to be where she goes when she's lonely
The last door of the night she's closing
Oh, I know she could have anything, but

She wants my hands on her body
She wants to burn like she's made of fire
Said she ain't going home 'til we
Drink every drop of Kentucky dry
Don't even know what she'll do when she does it
Palm of her hand, I'm hers in the blink of an eye
She don't take no and I love
She gets what she wants

I get to be what she wants tonight

And I don't know how I got to be
The only thing she needs right now, uh

She wants my hands on her body
She wants to burn like she's made of fire
Said she ain't going home 'til we
Drink every drop of Kentucky dry
Don't even know what she'll do when she does it
Palm of her hand, I'm hers in the blink of an eye

And nothing seemed to ring true
I couldn't bear the cross
For‚ÄÖeverything‚ÄÖI'd been through
And‚ÄÖeach day, I knew I needed‚ÄÖchange
But there was no way, no way

And then God whispered‚Åüyour‚Åüname

For the first time in a while

Well, call it fate or faith or call it crazy either way
It's amazin', amazin' grace

It's just what I needed to hear, baby
It couldn't have been more loud and clear

When God whispered your name
That's when everything changed
Love came out of the rain (Out of the rain)
And talk about being saved
Oh, suddenly I wanna live
More than I ever did
I'm never gonna be the same
When God whispered your name, oh yeah

(Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah)
Ooh, Hallelujah, baby
(Hallelujah) Oh, yeah, hmm-hmm (Hallelujah)
(Hallelujah) Ooh yeah
I can see the sunlight shinin' through your pretty eyes, baby
(Hallelujah) Woo, hmm (Hallelujah)
I like a man who leaves, time feels like Hell
(Hallelujah) Got my hands up high, I got my hands up to the sky
(Hallelujah) Ooh, I'm sayin' thank you (Hallelujah)
(Hallelujah)
(Hallelujah, Hallelujah)
(Hallelujah)

Pictures on her phone and tears in her eyes
Waterproof makeup ain't made for a breakup on a Saturday night
Then it's hey how you been, good how 'bout you
Funny how seeing you once after a few months
Gets you locked out
Right back to telling folks you know I know
All about some new guy taking you out
Then you unfollow me then follow me back
Just so I know you're still around

Some girls get their mama on the phone
Take a trip back home, pretend they never knew the guy
Some girls drink a bottle of wine
Got an old ex to text to get 'em through the getting by
Sometimes it's a clean break, stay gone
Clean slate moving on to something new
Sometimes some girls make it easy on you
But some girls never do

Some hearts stay broke, some hearts don't skip a beat
Some people say goodbye then try to make it alright
Just like you're doing to me, but tonight I'm letting it ring

Some girls get their mama on the phone
Take a trip back home, pretend they never knew the guy
Some girls drink a bottle of wine
Got an old ex to text to get 'em through the getting by
Sometimes it's a clean break, stay gone
Clean slate, moving on to something new
Sometimes some girls make it easy on you
But some girls never do
No some girls never do

Yeah some girls know when they've got something
Worth holding on to, but some girls never do

Some girls get their mama on the phone
Take a trip back home, pretend they never knew the guy
Some girls drink a bottle of wine
Got an old ex to text to get 'em through the getting by
Sometimes it's a clean break, stay gone
Clean slate, moving on to something new
Sometimes some girls make it easy on you
But some girls never do

Yeah some girls never do
Sometimes some girls make it easy on you
But some girls never do

I didn't think I was a bad guy
I knew that you were good
You were golden‚ÄÖon‚ÄÖthe inside
And you‚ÄÖloved me the best you could
I'm‚ÄÖthe one who dropped the ball
Got you high and let you fall
Let the best thing I ever had slip away

What does that say about me
That I could do you like I did
That I could break an angel's wings
What does that say about me
That I stood there like a fencepost
As you drove off in your car
What does that say about me
Now that I've broke your pretty heart
Your pretty heart

I've been drinking like a drunkard
In these Austin neon light
Burning smoke and wondering
If there's anything I've done right
Well I wish that I could go back
Hang on to what I had
Guess that's all, babe
Nothing but a dream

What does that say about me
That I could do you like I did
That I could break an angel's wings
What does that say about me
That I stood there like a fencepost
As you drove off in your car
What does that say about me
Now that I've broke your pretty heart
Your pretty heart

What does that say about me
That I could do you like I did
That I could break an angel's wings
What does that say about me
That I stood there like a fencepost
As you drove off in your car
What does that say about me
Now that I've broke your pretty heart
Your pretty heart
Your pretty heart
Your pretty heart

Lights go down, wheels go 'round
I'm taking you home
Hoping for a slow song to come on the radio now
I'm not ready to shut it down
The way the dashboard glow
Is hitting your eyes making me lose everything on my mind
And the only thing I wanna do is find a spot
Stop this car and throw it in park and just

Slow dance with you
Spinning you around by the Walmart sign
And moving our feet over the painted white lines
Getting close to you
Making the most of whatever we got
Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot
(Slow dance in a parking lot)

A half song gone, one door open, across the lot
A rent-a-cop's rolling a security car
Its yellow lights spinning and flashing in time
To the radio singing a little Garth Brooks
You start humming the very last verse to "She's Every Woman"
And I don't care what song comes next
I'm falling right here, don't want a safety net in a

Slow dance with you
Spinning you around by the Walmart sign
And moving our feet over the painted white lines
Getting close to you
Making the most of whatever we got
Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot

And get close to you
Making the most of whatever we got, even if it's just

A slow dance with you
Spinning you around by the Walmart sign
And moving our feet over the painted white lines
Getting close to you
Making the most of whatever we got
Even if it's just a slow dance in a parking lot

Same old dive, same old end of the work week drink
Bartender knows my name, but I don't mind
She kicks 'em up strong, serves me up right

And here I go again, I'm drinkin' one, I'm drinkin' two
I got my heartache medication, a strong dedication
To gettin' over you, turnin' me loose
On that hardwood jukebox lost in neon time
My heartache medication, well, it suits me fine
And I'm drinkin' enough to take you off my mind
I got my heartache medication

Another girl, another dance to a country song
Turnin' me on, here's to a good time
And halfway to feelin' alright

And here I go again, I'm drinkin' one, I'm drinkin' two
I got my heartache medication, a strong dedication
To gettin' over you, turnin' me loose
On that hardwood jukebox lost in neon time
My heartache medication, well it suits me fine
And I'm drinkin' enough to take you off my mind
I got my heartache medication

Single, drinkin' doubles
Teardrops turnin' into bubbles
Yeah, a little later on
I'll probably find me some trouble

And here I go again, I'm drinkin' one, I'm drinkin' two
I got my heartache medication, a strong dedication
To gettin' over you, turnin' me loose
On that hardwood jukebox lost in neon time
My heartache medication, well it suits me fine
And I'm drinkin' enough to take you off my mind
I got my heartache medication

Heartache medication takin' me away
Oh whoa

Seen the skyline of New York City
Fireflies in Tennessee
Sipped a little shine from a paper‚ÄÖsack‚ÄÖthat'll
Knock the horns‚ÄÖoff a Cadillac
I must've sat on‚ÄÖa dozen islands
Watched the sun sink into the sea
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt and hat
But my favorite place to be is

Here and now
Nowhere else in this world enough
You and me, ain't it good to be alive?
Ain't no better place, ain't no better time
Than here and now
Everybody's waiting, but they're waiting on what?
Better get to living 'cause all we've got is here and now

Think I fell in love for the first time
With a girl from Mexico
Thought I found a true love in Malibu, but
That water was a little too cold
Yeah, I left a few tears in the rearview
One or two that were hard to forget
Why you think we call the present the present?
'Cause there ain't no better gift than

Here and now
Nowhere else in this world enough
You and me, ain't it good to be alive?
Ain't no better place, ain't no better time

Everybody's waiting, but they're waiting on what?
Better get to living 'cause all we've got is here and now

A lotta people dreaming 'bout one-day-some-days
Waiting just around the bend (Waiting just around the bend)
I used to be one wonderin' when they'd come
But now I'm livin' in (But now I'm livin' in)
Here and now
Yeah, I'm livin' in the

I wasn't tryna feel like this
I wasn't tryna feel nothin' at all
I just came to meet my friends
And try to drink a long week off
I didn't want to stay too late
I wasn't tryna close it down
I was doin' my own thing
Yeah, up until you sat down

I thought that I'd
Catch a buzz, catch a game
Catch up with the boys, the same old thing
Catch a cab back to my place
But then I saw your face
Now you got me tryna
Catch your eye, catch your name
Catch a spark and start a flame
The way you smile and I can't help myself
Girl, you got me tryna catch my breath
You got me tryna catch my breath, yeah

You got me doin' double-takes
You went and messed up all my plans
I only meant to hold this drink
Now I'm tryna hold your hand

Yeah, I thought that I'd
Catch a buzz, catch a game
Catch up with the boys, the same old thing
Catch a cab back to my place
But then I saw your face

Ooh, you got me tryna catch my breath, whoa

You got me catchin' feelin's
I wasn't even tryna feel this
I don't know how you started stealin'
My heart like you are in this bar
But I'm glad that you are

'Cause I just thought that I'd
Catch a buzz, catch a game
Catch up with the boys, the same old thing
Catch a cab back to my place

I ain't gonna stay for the weekend
I ain't gonna jump off the deep end
I ain't‚ÄÖgonna‚ÄÖask where your‚ÄÖring is
Thing is, we all got‚ÄÖsecrets

You don't wanna hear about my last break up
I don't wanna worry 'bout space you take up
I don't even care if you're here when I wake up

It's just a room key
You ain't gotta lie to me
Can't you just use me like I'm using you?
How it goes is, bar closes
There's no king bed covered in roses
Just a room without a view
I don't want a number you ain't gonna answer
Let's just stick to the one night standards

Well, I ain't Cinderella, but who is?
Call me what you want if the shoe fits
I ain't gonna say I never do this
'Cause truth is, lonely makes a heart ruthless

Ain't nobody gonna hurt nobody
Ain't nothing wrong with needing somebody
You can leave all that
Down in the lobby

It's just a room key
You ain't gotta lie to me
Can't you just use me like I'm using you?
How it goes is, bar closes
There's no king bed covered in roses
Just a room without a view
No, I don't want a number you ain't gonna answer
Let's just stick to the one night standards

How it goes is, bar closes
There's no king bed covered in roses
Just a room without a view
No, I don't give a damn about the morning after
Bottles on the floor don't even matter
I don't want a number you ain't gonna answer
Let's just stick to the one night standards
The one night standards

Girl, I‚Äôve always loved you, oh, but something‚Äôs changed
Blame it on time, the road or‚ÄÖthe‚ÄÖride, but it‚ÄÖain't the same
It‚Äôs a different kind‚ÄÖof feeling, not the one I knew
From the sweet on your lips, to how your hand in mine fits
Girl, I've always loved you, but

I don‚Äôt love you like I used to
This gets better every time you kiss me like this
It‚Äôs stronger the longer I'm with you, yeah
More than every single day before
Didn‚Äôt know I could ever love you more than I did
But baby, I do, I don't love you like I used to, no

What we got ain't got no ending, like a band of solid gold
It‚Äôs sweeter with time like strawberry wine, it gets as good as it gets old
And oh, we thought we knew what it meant way back then
Oh, but I keep fallin' all in higher than I've ever been, oh no, oh

'Cause it's Friday
'Cause it's Monday
'Cause it's a charcoal-burnin' Sunday
'Cause we ain't gonna get to one day

Yeah, life is like a jukebox, just push play
Not everybody's first word sounds the same
But we all get born and we all get raised
Whether it's some boondocks or Marina Del Rey
Everybody turns wild when you're 16
Slow roll, big timin' on Main Street
Everybody's got holes in their blue jeans
If you bought 'em that way or not

Turn it up and sing along
We all work 'til the daylight's gone
We all knock off the edge around five
Fall in love from a kiss on Friday night
And we've all had a broken heart
We've all closed down a few good bars
Take a look around, y'all, tell me I'm wrong
Ain't the whole wide world just one big country song?
Just one big country song

Yeah, well who gon' try to find some water when it's hot? (When it's hot)
Whether it's a pontoon, tube or a yacht (Yeah)
Who ain't got a dog that they love like a brother? (I do)
And who ain't ever tasted better cookin' than their mother?
Who ain't got a story to tell?
And who ain't made it through some hell?
Who don't love somebody, don't miss somebody?
If you're down, sing it with somebody

Turn it up and sing along

Got a call from a friend about a friend
With some news no one ever wants‚ÄÖto‚ÄÖhear
It hit me‚ÄÖlike a punch, it took my‚ÄÖbreath
He was just gettin' into his best years
Yeah, somethin' like that'll shake you up
Wake you up

So I stopped off at a Texaco, bought a Slim Jim and a coke
Parked out by the water just to watch that river flow
Grabbed my guitar from the back seat, wrote a song just for me
And I sung it for the blue sky and a couple live oak trees
I thought of home, grabbed my phone from my pocket
And I called mama

It rang a couple times, and she picked up
I can always hear her smile when I call
I just called to tell you that I loved you
I was missing you and dad and home, that's all
I got to really thinking this morning
About what's important

So I stopped off at a Texaco, bought a Slim Jim and a coke
Parked out by the water just to watch that river flow
Grabbed my guitar from the back seat, wrote a song just for me
And I sung it for the blue sky and a couple live oak trees
I thought of home, grabbed my phone from my pocket
And I called mama

And from now on
I ain't gonna wait so long

To stop off at a Texaco, buy a Slim Jim and a coke
Park out by the water just to watch that river flow
Grab my guitar from the back seat, write a song just for me
Sing it for the blue sky and a couple live oak trees
I think of home, grab my phone from my pocket
Instead of sayin' tomorrow, I'm gonna

It's supposed to hurt, it's a broken heart
But to movin' on is the hardest part
It comes in waves, the letting go
But the memory fades, everybody knows
Everybody knows

What if I'm tryin', but then I close my eyes
And then I'm right back, lost in that last goodbye?
And what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do?
What if I never get over you?

Maybe months go by, maybe years from now
And I meet someone and it's workin' out
Every now and then, he can see right through
'Cause when I look at him
Yeah, all I  see is you

What if I'm tryin', but then I close my eyes
And then I'm right back, lost in that last goodbye?
And what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do?
What if I never get over you?

Ooh yeah
What if I never get over?
What if I never get closure?
What if I never get back all the wasted words I told ya?
What if It never gets better?
What if this lasts forever and ever and ever?

I'm tryin', but then I close my eyes
And then I'm right back, lost in that last goodbye
And what if time doesn't do what it's supposed to do?
What if I never get over you?
What if I gave you (What if I gave you) everything I got?
What if your love was my one and only shot?
What if I end up with nothing to compare it to
What if I never get over? Oh, if I never get over
What if I never get over you?

What if I never get over you?

It's a big ol' world outside this little town
Thought that's all I needed to drown you out
It was gonna be easy, it was supposed to be easy
Put some days, put some miles in the rearview
A few state lines between me and you
Just a little space and time and I'd be fine

I've been from Savannah to Long Beach
Trying to keep your memory out of reach
But there you were in the Delta nights
The Santa Fe sun, the Colorado sky
I could add another push pin to the map
But that don't stop me from missing you and looking back
Guess there's just one place I haven't gone
I've moved everywhere but on

My mail's still going to mama's house
'Cause I'm still long gone trying to figure out
Who I am without you and why I still think about you
Just biding my time making ends meet
Loading trucks, pouring coffee, pouring concrete
Planning my next move for getting over you, yeah

I've been from Savannah to Long Beach
Trying to keep your memory out of reach

Would have led me home by now

Done
The first time I saw you, done
By the first dance was through, I was done
That‚ÄÖone‚ÄÖkiss I knew
There‚ÄÖwas nothing I wouldn't do just‚ÄÖto give you

That house on the hill with the 4-plank around it
Every last breath 'til the last star is counted
Just say the word, girl
Paint me your perfect
I won't quit 'til the good Lord says my work is done
Like a faded out song on the radio, done
Like the cowboy gets the girl when the credits roll
I'd give you a lifetime of days in the sun
Whatever you need and you want
I won't stop 'til it's done

Done
All the hell I was raising, done
All the careless heart-breaking, done
For the chance that you're taking
I spend my nights praying and all my days chasing

Every last breath 'til the last star is counted
Just say the word, girl

I won't quit 'til the good Lord says my work is done
Like a faded out song on the radio, done
Like the cowboy gets the girl when the credits roll
I'd give you a lifetime of days in the sun
Whatever you need and you want
I won't stop 'til it's done

You know I won't stop 'til it's done
You need a man you can lean on, done
You need some faith you can hang your dreams on
Check 'em off one by one

And that house on the hill with the 4-plank around it
Every last breath 'til the last star is counted
Just say the word, girl
Paint me your perfect
I won't quit 'til the good Lord says my work is done
Like a faded out song on the radio, done
Like the cowboy gets the girl when the credits roll
I'd give you a lifetime of days in the sun
Whatever you need and you want
I won't stop 'til it's done
Baby, I won't stop 'til it's done
Oh you know I ain't done
First time I saw you, done

Hey, homecoming queen
Why do you lie?
When somebody's mean
Where do you hide?
Do people assume
You're always alright?
Been‚ÄÖso‚ÄÖgood at smiling
Most‚ÄÖof your life

Look damn good in‚ÄÖthe dress
Zipping up the mess
Dancing with your best foot forward
Does it get hard
To have to play the part?
Nobody's feeling sorry for ya

But what if I told you the world wouldn't end
If you started showing what's under your skin?
What if you let 'em all in on the lie?
Even the homecoming queen cries
Oh

Hey, homecoming queen
How's things at home?
Still walking on eggshells
When that curtain's closed?
Did your Daddy teach you
How to act tough?
Or more like your Mama
Sweep it under the rug?

Look damn good in the dress
Zipping up the mess
Dancing with your best foot forward
Did you want the crown?
Or does it weigh you down?
Nobody's feeling sorry for ya

What if I told you the world wouldn't end
If you started showing what's under your skin?
What if you let 'em all in on the lie?
Even the homecoming queen cries
Yeah, what if I told you the sky wouldn't fall?
If you lost your composure, said to hell with it all
Not everything pretty sparkles and shines
And even the homecoming queen cries (Ooh)
Oh yeah (Ooh)
Even the homecoming queen cries (Ooh)
Mmm-mmm, mmm (Ooh)

Hey, homecoming queen
Why do you lie?
When somebody's mean
Where do you hide?

All of my friends finally convinced me to get out of the house
To help me‚ÄÖforget,‚ÄÖto help me‚ÄÖmove on
Then I heard you're back‚ÄÖin town
In a crowd of strangers and lovers
Someone told me‚Åüthat‚Åüyou‚Åüwere comin'

So I‚Åüshould probably go‚Åüto bed (Ah)
I should probably turn off my phone
I should quit while I'm ahead (Ah)
I should probably leave you alone
'Cause I know in the mornin' (In the mornin')
I'll be callin' (I'll be callin')
Sayin' "sorry" for the things I said
So I, yeah, I should probably go to bed

So I don't undo the got-over-you
That I took so long to find
'Cause all it would take is seein' your face and I'd forget

So I should probably go to bed (Ah)
I should probably turn off my phone
I should quit while I'm ahead (Ah)
I should probably leave you alone
'Cause I know in the mornin' (In the mornin')
I'll be callin' (I'll be callin')
Sayin' "sorry" for the things I said
So I, yeah, I should probably go to bed

Before I question my decision
Is it love? I know it isn't
Now I'm all up in my head again
'Cause I know I don't have the self-control
To walk away if you walk in
Oh, I know, I know, I know, I know
I should probably go to bed

Ooh, I'm all up in my head (I'm all up in my head)
Ooh, I, I should go to bed (Go to bed)
Ooh, I'm (Go to bed) all up in my head (Go to bed)
Ooh, I, I should go to bed

In a crowd of strangers and lovers
Someone told me that you were comin'
So I should probably go to bed

I'm a little bit a ball cap
Little bit a pearl snap button down shirt
Little bit a big city concrete
But a lot more small town dirt

I can see your pretty eyes
Reading me like a map
Wondering who I am
And where I'm at

I'm in between
Friday night wild
And quiet Sunday morning
Between
Done after one
And keep on pouring
Ain't too high
Ain't too low
Just holding down the middle
I'm steady as I go
I ain't all holy water
And I ain't all Jim Beam
I'm somewhere in between

I can be a steel toe work boot
40 hour blue collar, mud on my jeans
Then on weekend pack a bag
Disappear kick back on a white sand beach

I'm a far cry from being
A one night stand
But I ain't ready
For a ring on my hand

I'm in between
Friday night wild
And quiet Sunday morning
Between
Done after one
And keep on pouring
Ain't too high
Ain't too low
Just holding down the middle
I'm steady as I go
I ain't all holy water
And I ain't all Jim Beam
I'm somewhere in between

I can see your pretty eyes
Reading me like a map
Wondering who I am
And where I'm at

And quiet Sunday morning

Done after one

Ain't too high
Ain't too low
Just holding down the middle

I'm somewhere in between
Yeah I'm somewhere in between

I wish girls you loved never gave back diamond rings
I wish every porch had a swing
Wish kids still learned to say "sir" and "ma'am", how to shake a hand
I wish every state had a Birmingham

I wish everybody knew all the words to Mama Tried
I wish Monday mornings felt just like Friday nights

And I wish even cars had truck beds
And every road was named Copperhead
And coolers never run out of cold Bud Light
And I wish high school home teams never lost
And back road drinkin' kids never got caught
And I wish the price of gas was low and cotton was high
I wish honky tonks didn't have no closing time
And I wish grandpas never died

I wish Sunday's on a creek bank would never end
Wish I could learn to drive again
Wish the first time, seventeen, she was my everything kiss in a Chevrolet could happen every day

I wish everybody overseas was gonna make it home
I wish Country music still got played on Country radio

And I wish even cars had truck beds
And every road was named Copperhead
And coolers never run out of cold Bud Light
And I wish high school home teams never lost
And back road drinkin' kids never got caught
And I wish the price of gas was low and cotton was high
I wish honky tonks didn't have no closing time
And I wish grandpas never died
Never died

And I wish good dogs never got grey and old
I wish farms never got sold

And I wish even cars had truck beds
And every road was named Copperhead
And coolers never run out of cold Bud Light
I wish high school home teams never lost
And back road drinkin' kids never got caught
And I wish the price of gas was low and cotton was high
I wish honky tonks didn't have no closing time
And I wish grandpas never died
I wish grandpas never died

Her hands wrapped up in mine
Tears rollin' out of her eyes
No messin' with a made-up mind
Sun settin' on goodbye
Yeah, it's hard to believe
It wasn't me tryin' to leave this time

It ain't always the cowboy
That ain't got a lot of hang around
Ain't got no settle down in their boots
Gone's just what they do
That restless running, searchin' for something
Leavin' love in the dust of a midnight Chevrolet
It ain't always the cowboy that rides away

I've never seen over from this side
Never heard lonely get this quiet
Still, I can't keep from smiling
'Cause, damn, that girl can fly

It ain't always the cowboy
That ain't got a lot of hang around
Ain't got no settle down in their boots
Gone's just what they do
That restless running, searchin' for something
Leavin' love in the dust of a midnight Chevrolet
It ain't always the cowboy that rides away

A tumbleweed heart chasin' that wind
Goin' too far, wherever that is

It ain't always the cowboy
That ain't got a lot of hang around
Ain't got no settle down in their boots
Gone's just what they do
That restless running, searchin' for something
Leavin' love in the dust of a midnight Chevrolet
It ain't always the cowboy that rides away
Rides away
It ain't always the cowboy

Where I grew up, gettin' dressed up means
Buttoned down shirt and a good pair of jeans
Wasn‚Äôt Sunday supper without collard greens
Dad was boss, Christ is king
Friday night was livin' for them lights to come on
Then I turned to Miller Lites when I turned 21
There's some things about me that I can‚Äôt change
I'll always be the man that home made

Home made me love a dirt road
Home made me crave some ice cold homemade
Sweet tea only mama knows how to make
Homemade
Home made me love a small town
Home made me wanna settle down in a home made
For the two of us
Everything I love is homemade

My pickup lines didn't seem to work
Guess my pickup truck must've got to her
Windows down, singin' every word
Of that George Strait mixtape that was homemade

Home made me love a dirt road
Home made me crave some ice cold homemade
Sweet tea only mama knows how to make
Homemade
Home made me love a small town
Home made me wanna settle down in a home made
For the two of us
Everything I love is homemade

Hey, what we got you can't get from a store
Hey, the good stuff comes from the good Lord
Homemade

Home made me love a dirt road
Home made me crave some ice cold homemade
Sweet tea only mama knows how to make

Home made me love a small town
Home made me wanna settle down in a home made

I've always been a rollin' stone
With a reckless streak
Yeah, the grass never gets too grown
Underneath‚ÄÖmy‚ÄÖfeet
The city lights,‚ÄÖSouthern stars
No such thing's gone too‚ÄÖfar

I'm running wide open
I was born with my feet in‚Åümotion
But‚Åüsince‚ÅüI met you,‚ÅüI swear
I could‚Åübe happy anywhere
Any mapped out location
You're always my destination
You're the only thing that I'm chained to
I could be happy anywhere
I could be happy anywhere with you

Yeah, the beauty of the northern lights
And my mind is faded
The blue sky over Telluride
Next to you's kinda overrated
The winding road, let it twist
My home's wherever your heart is

I'm running wide open
I was born with my feet in motion
But since I met you, I swear
I could be happy anywhere
Any mapped out location
You're always my destination
You're the the only thing that I'm chained to
I could be happy anywhere
I could be happy anywhere with you

Hey!
Hey!

So, girl, I hope you know
Wherever you go, I go, I know

Yeah, you used to talk about
Getting even further South
Somewhere where the summer lasted all year‚ÄÖ'round
Probably‚ÄÖgot a big‚ÄÖol' diamond on your hand right‚ÄÖnow
Maybe a baby or a couple by now
Long driveway to a big white house

But I wonder when you're drinking if you
Find yourself thinking about
That boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better
But we still said forever
And that was seven summers
Of Coke and Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger, who knows?
Back then, you used to love the river
And sippin' on a sixer with me
Does it ever make you sad to know
That was seven summers ago?

Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

Yeah, I bet your daddy's so proud
Of how his little girl turned out
Think she dodged a bullet
Of a good old boy like me
'Cause I still
Go drinkin', same friends on Friday
Bought a few acres, couple roads off the highway
Guess you never saw things my way anyway

But I wonder when you're drinking if you
Find yourself thinking about
That boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better
But we still said forever

Long legs, cut off jeans
Pulling me in like a magnet
Your eyes locked on me
I knew right then I had to have you

Right here in the middle of the floor
Of this hole-in-the-wall on a back street
I knew I had to get close to you

Girl what's your name, what you drinking?
Yeah what's your favorite song?
If you're thinking what I'm thinking
We ain't gonna be in this bar too long
We'll be sneaking on out to your car
Stealing kisses out there in the dark
Yeah it might be too soon to say I love you
But you're gonna make me want to

Soft hands touching on me
Lighting me up like a bonfire
Your lips are making me think
This is gonna be an all-nighter

Right here in the middle of the crowd
You're the center of the world on a barstool
Oh yeah I had to get close to you, girl

Uh, yeah
This town ain't got no nightclub
We don't need the neon lights
Girl, I got that '87 gassed up
Thirty early out there in your drive
Got you a Bullet and a koozie, keep it ice cold
You take a sip 'fore we get gone
Lookin' at you with your hand out the window
I'm turnin' right while you're turnin' me on, yeah

Ridin' roads that don't nobody go down
A little trip through the countryside
These 38s makin' the world go 'round
I hit a curb just to make you slide
The only light is a flashing yellow
Only thing that I want is your kiss
I'm lovin' nothin' to do with you, baby
Just ridin' roads on a night like this

Ridin' roads

Out there where the moon hits the water
Out there where your lips hit mine
I don't know where we are
'Cause somebody stole the street signs
I'ma take my sweet time, yeah
'Cause I could go on forever
With you there ridin' shotgun, yeah
All our friends are probably makin' plans, baby
Yeah, but we already got one
We'll be

Ridin' roads that don't nobody go down
A little trip through the countryside
These 38s makin' the world go 'round

Only thing that I want is your kiss
I'm lovin' nothin' to do with you, baby
Just ridin' roads on a night like this

Ridin' roads

I got one hand on the wheel
And I got the other tryna cross the line, line, line
Yeah, the way you make feel
I wanna keep it rollin' 'til the sunri-ri-rise

Ridin' roads that don't nobody go down
A little trip through the countryside
These 38s makin' the world go 'round

Love, I've been looking for a while
Been‚Ää close a couple times
Man,‚Ää she's hard to find
And towns everywhere along the map
Well, I've traveled there and back
And‚Ää I wonder where she's at

Yeah,‚Ää maybe she's in Dallas
Cheering for the Cowboys
Maybe‚Ää laying low down in Mexico
I know she loves the sunshine
Yeah, maybe she's in Vegas
At a table dealing Blackjack
Hey,‚Ää if you wouldn't mind, if you see her out tonight
Tell her she's mine (Yeah, boy)

Life, it's a crazy ride, isn't it?
And I'm loving every minute
But it'd be better with her in it, yeah

Maybe she's living in a small town
And she's taught to fear the Bible
But she's got a couple friends that she runs around with
Dancin' with the Devil
Maybe she's sittin' in a caf√©
In a lonely, crowded city
Hey, if you wouldn't mind, if you see her out tonight
Tell her she's mine (Come on)

Tell her I'm comin', I'm runnin'
Yeah, I'm sorry I'm late
That I want her, I love her
And I just can't wait to meet her someday

Hell, maybe she's a hippie
Hangin' on the west coast
With flowers in her hair, probably doesn't care
'Bout nothin' but a good time
Maybe she's living up in New York
Working down on Wall Street
Hey, if you wouldn't mind, if you see her out tonight
Tell her she's mine

Yeah, tell her she's mine
Tell her she's mine
Hey, if you wouldn't mind, if you see her out tonight

Broken people down with words
More grace than I deserve, for sure

Sweatpants, t-shirt, in her comfy chair, hmm
Her hair in a bun, one hand on a mug
And the other one‚Äôs playin' snare
To a George Strait vinyl, that yes-or-no line will get her close

Just how far I‚Äôve been lettin' my heart fall
But what's in my head

She don't know I got some big, big plans
Build a little house out on some hand-me-down land
Find a little island where we go to get tan
I bet we take our kids down there one day
And I know she wouldn't mind if I
Did a little somethin' like find a flight
Overnight to paradise and leave tonight
And I'ma put a diamond on her hand

Well, she don‚Äôt know, well, she don‚Äôt know

Hid it in the bottom left drawer, right beside the sink
A shiny emerald diamond on a brand-new band
Asked her mama for permission and her daddy for her hand

'Cause right now, we're back in her hometown
And I'm down on one knee
I guess she finally figured out
I'm gonna ask her to marry me

I got some big, big plans
Build a little house out on some hand-me-down land
Find a little island where we go to get tan
I bet we take our kids down there one day
And I know she wouldn't mind if I
Did a little somethin' like find a flight
Overnight to paradise and leave tonight
And I'ma put a diamond on her hand

She don't know I got some big, big plans
Well, she don't know, well, she don't know
She don't know I got some big, big plans
Well, she don't know, well, she don't know

If it's Friday you know I'll be
Kickin' back with the boys down at Santa's pub
But don't hesitate, don't even think about waiting, nah just type it up
Yeah, I'm ready if you're ready or wonderin'
Stop thinking, hit send

Doesn't matter if it's last call from a late night sidewalk
A little too buzzed, a little too drunk
You could have your hair down, all curled up on the couch
And the quiet ain't loud enough, nah
It could be A.M. or P.M. ¬†
It could be middle of the week or the weekend, baby
It ain't too late or too far
Just call me 'cause I'm lonely
If you are, if you are
Yeah, I'm lonely if you are
If you are, if you are, yeah
Yeah, I'm lonely if you are

If it's Monday and it's over
You know the show your girls all come over for
And the red wine's getting lower
And your last friend's out the door
When there's no more roses to go around
Hit me up girl, you know I'm down

It doesn't matter if it's last call from a late night sidewalk
A little too buzzed, a little too drunk
You could have your hair down, all curled up on the couch
And the quiet ain't loud enough, nah
It could be A.M. or P.M. ¬†
It could be middle of the week or the weekend, baby
It ain't too late or too far
Just call me 'cause I'm lonely
If you are, if you are
Yeah, I'm lonely if you are
If you are, if you are
Yeah, I'm lonely if you are

Oh, let me love the lonely right out of you
Oh, let me love the lonely right out of you
Oh yeah, if you're out there and lonely, girl, I'm lonely, too
So let me love the lonely right out of you

It doesn't matter if it's last call from a late night sidewalk
Little too buzzed, a little too drunk
You could have your hair down, all curled up on the couch
And the quiet ain't loud enough, no
It could be A.M. or P.M. ¬†
It could be middle of the week or the weekend, baby
It ain't too late or too far
Just call me 'cause I'm lonely
If you are, if you are, yeah
Yeah, I'm lonely if you are
If you are, if you are, yeah
Oh, I'm lonely if you are

A 40 HP Johnson on a flat bottom metal boat
Coke cans and BB guns, barbed wire and old fence posts
8-point bucks in autumn and freshly cut cornfields
One arm out the window and one hand on the wheel

Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here

Your license in my wallet when we go out downtown
Your lipstick's stained every coffee cup that I got in this house
The way you say, "I love you, too" is like rain on an old tin roof
And your hand fits right into mine like a needle in a groove

Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here

Sometimes we're oil and water
But I wouldn't have it any other way
And if I'm being honest
Your first and my last name

Would just sound better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here
And me, as long as you're right here

I killed my first monster when I was seven years old
He melted like butter in my bathroom's sixty-watt bulb
Kept a three-cell MagLite from Daddy's workshop drawer
Under my pillow and I'd pull it like a sword

Anymore when a restless feelin' keeps me up at night
Fallin' on my knees is my new turnin' on the light
I keep my faith intact, make sure my prayers are said
'Cause I've learned that the monsters ain't the ones beneath the bed

The wolf hunts a hungry man and the devil a lonely heart
A minefield of bad decisions lay hidin' in the dark
Greed stalks, sickness steals, and pride lays a wicked trap
You can't avoid 'em all, no, you gotta trust me on that

Anymore when a restless feelin' keeps me up at night
Fallin' on my knees is my new turnin' on the light
I keep my faith intact, and make sure my prayers are said
'Cause I've learned that the monsters ain't the ones beneath the bed

Daddy, check my closet, leave on the bathroom light
I smile and say, "All clear" when I tuck him in for the night
But Daddy, I'm still scared, can I sleep with you instead?
I kneel down beside my little man and I bow my head

Anymore when a restless feelin' keeps me up at night
Fallin' on my knees is my new turnin' on the light
I keep my faith intact, make sure my prayers are said
'Cause I've learned that the monsters ain't the ones beneath the bed
And I've learned that the monsters ain't underneath the bed

Well turn that bottle up and drink it, crank that jukebox up and Hank it
Bartender, pour another round
Here's to our best bad decisions, situation no conditions
Oh, and memories we all need to drown
So, fill your cup and raise it up
Jump in and join the club
And float this whiskey river reservoir
We're gonna spend the weekend in the deep end of a dive bar

'Cause up in here you're not the only loved and left her
Lost and lonely one who's ever swam against the tide
Thinkin' this is your oasis, it's the safest of the places
That a broken heart can find to hide
So, here's a toast coast to coast
With a big old adios
To wishes wasted on them fallin' stars
We're gonna spend the weekend in the deep end of a dive bar

Yeah it's just chapter after chapter of happy never after
But that's just the way the story goes
For some barstool believers wear our heart out on our sleevers
Just goin' where the neon glows


Yeah, it's just chapter after chapter of happy never after
But that's just the way the story goes
Yeah, we're just never quite belongers, hanger on-ers way too longers
Just buzzin' where the neon glows

Problems, we all got 'em
Let 'em sink down to the bottom
Doesn't matter who or where you are
We're gonna spend the weekend in the deep end
The water's fine, y'all, so just come on in
To the deep end of a dive bar
Of this dive bar
Talkin' 'bout a dive bar

Hey, buddies that I grew up with
All straight-laced and married up now
You ain't foolin' me, wasn't long ago
We tore the roof off that one red light town
And hey, darlin', sippin' that red wine
All classy, kicked back on the couch
You smile and I see ya shootin' tequila
Us shuttin' them college bars down

And no matter how much time goes by
And no matter how much we grow up
For worse or for better, from now 'til forever
I'll always remember you young

And hey, babies, crawlin‚Äô on the carpet
No, you won‚Äôt be that little for long
One day, you‚Äôll move away, but you‚Äôre still gonna stay
This innocent after you‚Äôre gone

'Cause no matter how much time goes by
And no matter how much you grow up
For worse or for better, from now 'til forever
I'll always remember you young

Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, oh, oh

Yeah, I hope when we get to Heaven
He looks at us all like we're kids
Shameless and painless and perfect and ageless
Forgives all the wrong that we did

And no matter how much time goes by
I hope we never have to grow up
We'll say for worse or for better, from now 'til forever
I'll always remember you young

Whoa-oh-oh, oh
I'll always remember you young

We just tryna catch a good time
Even if it takes all night
Pass that bottle 'round‚ÄÖthe‚ÄÖcampfire
Sippin' apple pie‚ÄÖmoonshine
Yeah, we pickin' on them guitars‚ÄÖjust right
Everybody singin' "Dixieland Delight"
Like a bobber on a wet line
We just tryna catch a good time

Eighty degrees and the sun ain't even out
We got a spot a couple miles outta town
When that moon comes up, you know what's goin' down
We got them foldin' chairs leanin way back
No other plans other than relax
We ain't worried 'bout tomorrow from where we at

We just tryna catch a good time
Even if it takes all night
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire
Sippin' apple pie moonshine
Yeah, we pickin' on them guitars just right
Everybody singing Dixieland Delight
Like a bobber on a wet line
We just tryna catch a good time

Way down here, we all got that Southern drawl
Take our time when we talkin', "Hey Y'all"
Yeah, it don't take much for us to have it all (That's right)
Something 'bout a night this clear
Makes your problems disappear
We just gonna stay right here and let the world go by

We just tryna catch a good time
Even if it takes all night
Pass that bottle 'round the campfire
Sippin' apple pie moonshine

Let me make one thing clear
You can buy me a beer, but you ain't taking me home
No pick up lines, I came here tonight to shed a few tears on my own
But sitting there across the room
I couldn't help but notice you seem a little down on your love too
Yeah, my heart might be breaking
But, this seat ain't taken
And you've got me thinkin'

We should be drinking alone, together
Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinking alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
We should be drinking alone, together (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

I don't know what she did to make you hurt like this
But, I know just what to do
It starts with a bottle of good Reposado
And ends with a shooter or two
Tomorrow when the sun comes up
Tonight‚Äôs the night that never was
Baby, just forget my name
Won't be your one and only
But just 'cause we're lonely, don't mean that we should

We should be drinking alone
'Cause drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinking alone
Drinking alone, drinking alone (Together)
Maybe we shouldn't be drinking alone (We should be drinking alone)
Drinking alone, drinking alone
Baby, we shouldn't be drinking alone

I'll pretend that I care
Baby, pull up a chair
We'll stay here 'til they make us go home

We should be drinking alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Oh, we should be drinking alone, together
Drownin' the pain is better
With somebody else who got problems
We ain't gonna solve 'em
But misery loves company
Tonight all I need is a stranger
Lips with a whiskey chaser
And a corner booth kiss to make me forget that he's gone
Oh, we should be drinking alone (Drinking alone, drinking alone) together
Maybe we shouldn't be drinking alone (We should be drinking alone)
Drinking alone, drinking alone
Baby, we shouldn't be drinking alone (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

We should be drinking alone
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh

I had one saying we were done
In a Baton Rouge college bar
It kinda came out‚ÄÖof‚ÄÖnowhere
Man, I took‚ÄÖthat one pretty hard (That one‚ÄÖpretty hard)
And I had another one in another town
And I spent a whole lot of nights missing her
'Til it all went black, she stopped texting back
And I finally got the picture

So here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the "hey, I think we need to talk"
And the "it ain't me, it's you" (Oh, it ain't me)
Here's to the tears and beers and wasted years
On the weeds that looked like daisies
I wouldn't be sitting here next to you
If it weren't for the almost maybes

Here's to the one that my family thought
Was gonna make me drop to one knee
And I tried like hell, but I couldn't help
My mama loved her more than me (Mama loved her more than me)
And to all those July crushes
Turning into September leavin's
Goodbyes that didn't feel good back then
It happened for a real good reason

Here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the "hey, I think we need to talk"
And the "it ain't me, it's you" (Oh, it ain't me)
Here's to the tears and beers and wasted years
On the weeds that looked like daisies
I wouldn't be sitting here next to you
If it weren't for the almost maybes
If not for the almost maybes (Yeah, the almost maybes)

Wouldn't be no all alones
Wouldn't be no sad songs
Wouldn't be no had enough
Pick yourself up and get to moving ons
From the didn't work outs
The girls next door and the bat shit crazies
There wouldn't be no you and me right now
If it weren't for the almost maybes

Here's to the almost, so close
It's over out of the blues
Here's to the "hey, I think we need to talk"
And the "it ain't me, it's you" (Oh, it ain't me)

I remember when I first heard your heartbeat
It had only been eight weeks
Standin' there, starin'‚ÄÖat‚ÄÖthat screen, was‚ÄÖthe
First time you ever scared me
God‚ÄÖknows I don't know
Exactly what I'm doin', but
Good news, we got her to get through it

I hope you look just like your momma
And love her like I do
You'll see close to perfect patience
If you watch your every move
You can always run to daddy
You'll always be my baby
But, look at her, baby girl
And you'll learn
How to be a lady
Just how to be a lady
Hmm-hmm

I can make you laugh 'til you cry
But she can make your tears dry, and
When you get your heart broke by the wrong guy
She can make it right

I hope you look just like your momma
And love her like I do
You'll see close to perfect patience
If you watch your every move
You can always run to daddy
You'll always be my baby
But, look at her, baby girl
And you'll learn
How to be a lady
Hmm-hmm
Just how to be a lady
Oh-oh, oh-oh


She'll hear you
She'll hold you
She'll help you through
She'll fix you
And me too

I hope you look just like your momma
And love her like I do (Love her like I do)
You'll see close to perfect patience
If you watch your every move (Every move)

Well the road rolls out like a welcome mat
To a better place than the one‚ÄÖwe're‚ÄÖat

But I've had‚ÄÖall of this town I can stand
And I got friends out on the coast
We can jump in the water and see what floats
We've been savin' for a rainy day
Let's beat the storm and be on our way

And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And Honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice
I can be your lucky penny, you can be my four-leaf clover
Startin' over

This might not be an easy time
There's rivers to cross and hills to climb
Some days we might fall apart
And some nights might feel cold and dark
But nobody wins afraid of losin'
And the hard roads are the ones worth choosin'
Someday we'll look back and smile
And know it was worth every mile

And it don't matter to me
Wherever we are is where I wanna be
And Honey, for once in our life
Let's take our chances and roll the dice
I can be your lucky penny, you can be my four-leaf clover

There are many people who drink in moderation with no problems
Social, moral, or medical
They have‚ÄÖlearned‚ÄÖto enjoy liquor‚ÄÖwithout letting it upset
The functioning of‚ÄÖtheir body and mind
It relaxes you, makes you more congenial‚Åü(I‚Åüjust‚Åühad one sip)
This‚Åühelps make a‚Åügathering cheerful and friendly

It ain't my fault, so don't blame me
I swear I just came here to unwind and have one drink
The way it looks, it ain't what you think
This Cabernet has a way of vanishing on me

There's a hole in the bottle leaking all this wine
It's already empty and it ain't even supper time
Honey, no, I don't miss him
In fact, it slipped my mind
There's a hole in the bottle of wine

I keep my cool, play by all the rules
I swear ten minutes ago that bottle was full
But I won't cry about love gone wrong
'Cause tears would water down this ruby red I'm sipping on

There's a hole in the bottle leaking all this wine
It's already empty and it ain't even supper time
Honey, no, I don't miss him
In fact, it slipped my mind
There's a hole in the bottle of wine (Aw, yeah)

I went and got a new one
'Cause the other one was broken
Now this one's halfway gone
And it's barely even open

There's a hole in the bottle (Hole in the bottle) leaking all this wine
It's already empty and it ain't even supper time
Honey, no, I don't miss him
In fact, it slipped my mind
There's a hole in the bottle of wine

You may ask me where it's going
But I can't even find
The hole in the bottle of wine

When the dogwoods start to bloom
And the crickets hum their tune
That's usually about the time
That‚ÄÖI‚ÄÖfeel most alive
But‚ÄÖthe news has all been bad
And‚ÄÖthe whole world seems so sad
I ain't had much else going on
So I sat down and wrote this song

I miss my mom, I miss my dad
Miss the road, I miss my band
Giving hugs and shaking hands
It's a mystery, I suppose
Just how long this thing goes
But there'll be crowds and there'll be shows
And there will be light after dark
Some day when we aren't six feet apart

First thing that I'm gonna do
Slide on in some corner booth
And take the whole damn family out
Buy my buddies all a round
Pay some extra on the tab
Catch a movie, catch a cab
Watch a ball game from the stands
Probably over-wash my hands

I miss my mom, I miss my dad
Miss the road, I miss my band
Giving hugs and shaking hands
Well, it's a mystery, I suppose
Just how long this thing goes
But there'll be crowds and there'll be shows
And there will be light after dark

<|EndOfSong|>

He's a phone call to his parents
He's a Bible by the bed
He's the T-shirt that I'm wearing
He's the song stuck in my head
He's solid and he's steady
Like the Allegheny runs
He knows just where he's going
And he's proud of where he's from

One of the good ones
He's one of the good ones

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones

You'll know him when you see him
By the way he looks at me
You'd say he hung the moon
I'd say he hung the galaxy
Nobody does it better
Oh, the way he pulls me in
I've known a couple bad ones
But they all led me to him

He's one of the good ones

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones

We should all find us one
They're out there, minus one
Some of the good ones
Yeah, I got a good one

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine

<|EndOfSong|>

Once I fall in love, then I'll be happy
But then you fall in love and‚ÄÖthere's‚ÄÖstill a hole
Once‚ÄÖI get some money, it'll all‚ÄÖbe easy
But then you get that money, you still feel broke

Once I get a little older, I won't worry
Then you get older and it don't feel like it should
I'm thinking once I learn to grow right where I'm planted
Maybe that's when life starts getting good

Once I get a car that don't stall in the morning
I can make it anywhere I want, just wait
But I can see it right now, sitting in my driveway
Afraid if I take it out, I'll chip the paint

Once I get a house that I can hang my hat on
I bet I'll want to build a bigger one if I could, yeah
I'm thinking, once I learn to grow right where I'm planted
Maybe that's when life starts getting good

Oh, getting good
Getting good
Life starts getting good
I'm thinking maybe that's when life starts getting good
(That's when life starts getting good, oh)
Hey, yeah

I'm afraid of both my parents dying
I call my dad, he answers right away
And I didn't hear a word 'cause I was thinking
About what hasn't happened yet but will someday

And we hang up the phone before I know it
I'm crying over the conversation my fear took
I'm thinking once I learn to soak up every moment
I'll realize my life's already good

Already good
Already good
Life's already good
I'll realize my life's already good
Thank God that my life's already good

Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it's 'cause of‚ÄÖme
Betty,‚ÄÖone time I‚ÄÖwas riding on my skateboard
When I‚ÄÖpassed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe

You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him

You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said "James, get in, let's drive"
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long

Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again

The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party

Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

Standing in your cardigan
Kissin' in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss you

<|EndOfSong|>

I haven't stopped thinking about you
Has it really been this long?
Two years and an ocean between us
And I don‚Äôt know where it all went wrong
I know I coulda kissed you harder
And yeah, you coulda followed through
Shoulda talked a little bit softer
But we meant every "I love you"

I don't know what this is or what it isn't
But it feels like we‚Äôve got unfinished business

Cause we left blood the on the tracks
Sweat on the saddle
Fire in the hills
A bullet in the barrel
Words never said in a story that didn't end
Looks like you're on the mend and I'm on the bottle
We folded our hands with money on the table
Tried moving on, but I keep coming back again
To what could've been...
What could've been
Oh, what could've been
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

A couple more simple I'm sorrys
A little less tryna be right
I wonder how many good mornings we wasted
‚ÄôCause we didn‚Äôt say goodnight
One touch before we fell asleep
Just before our love was out of reach
Coulda been enough, coulda saved us from this loneliness

We left blood the on the tracks
Sweat on the saddle
Fire in the hills
A bullet in the barrel
Words never said in a story that didn't end
Looks like you‚Äôre on the mend and I'm on the bottle
We folded our hands with money on the table
Tried moving on, but I keep coming back again
To what could've been...
What could've been
Oh, what could‚Äôve been
Oh

I thought I'd see it clearly from a distance
But it still feels like we've got unfinished business

'Cause baby, we left blood the on the tracks
Sweat on the saddle
Fire in the hills
A bullet in the barrel
Words never said in a story that didn't end
Looks like you're on the mend, I'm on the bottle
We folded our hands with money on the table
Tried moving on, but I keep coming back again
Oh, to what could've been
Oh, what could've been
Mmm, what could've been
Shoulda been

Do you still wonder?
Still wonder?

I see your face on every street
Every corner, couple trees
Even got our name on 'em
I‚ÄÖfeel‚ÄÖyour love, I‚ÄÖhear your laugh
Got them take-me-way-on-back
Hurt-me memories,‚ÄÖI don't want 'em
Up and down the boulevard
In and out of every bar

I'd burn this whole town down
Pick a spot, dig a hole, put them ashes in the ground
Baby, I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house
Damn girl, why'd you have to break it like that?
Leaving pieces of my shattered heart scattered like glass
I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house

I would start it when where we started at the downtown party
Where you kissed my lips and stole my beer
The city park in the dark where we looked up at the stars
Watched them fireworks pop last year
I'd start it under that Texaco sign where you said goodbye
I'd get some gas and drop a match right there

I'd burn this whole town down
Pick a spot, dig a hole, put them ashes in the ground
Baby, I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house
Damn girl, why'd you have to break it like that?
Leaving pieces of my shattered heart scattered like glass
I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house

Fire-red flames, sunsets in the sky
Going out, staying in, staying up, long nights
Now I'm waking up alone, wishing I could move on
Blocked your number in my phone, thought it'd help, but it don't

I'd burn this whole town down
Pick a spot, dig a hole, put them ashes in the ground
Baby, I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house
Damn girl, why'd you have to break it like that?
Leaving pieces of my shattered heart scattered like glass
I'd burn this whole town down
If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house

(Baby, I'd burn this whole town down)
(If it wasn't for my momma's house, my momma's house)

Take me on up to Detroit City
Jails are full, the factories empty
Mama's crying, young boys‚ÄÖdying
Under‚ÄÖthat red, white,‚ÄÖand blue still flying
Drop me off‚ÄÖin Baltimore
Where every other window's got a plywood board
Where dreams‚Åübecome‚Åüdrugs‚Åüand guns
The only‚Åüway out is‚Åüto shoot or run

Stick that in your country song, yeah
Take that one to number one, yeah
And get the whole world singing along, yeah
Stick that in your country song, yeah (Oh)

Sing about the man coming back from war
A 23 going on 54
He lost a friend, his sight, his hands
Baby girl he'll never see again

Stick that in your country song, yeah
Take that one to number one, yeah
And get the whole world singing along, man
Stick that in your country song, yeah (Oh)

I light the arrow, pull the bow
Shoot that fire right through my soul
Hit my pride, fist up high
I wanna feel the rush, I wanna feel alive
Oh, come on I want to pound the dash
Stomp the gas, drive too fast
Rock me hard, stop my heart
And blow the speakers right out of this car

Stick that in your country song, yeah
And take that one to number one, yeah (Number one, yeah)
And get the whole world singing along, man
Stick that in your country song
Stick that in your country song
Take that one to number one
I can sing this all night long, yeah
Stick that in your country song, yeah (Oh)

Gimme one about the teacher who
Tryna change a life or two
She'll be rocking out all night with you
Tomorrow, she'll be back in a red-brick school
Where kids are climbing off the walls
And it's scary walking down the hall
She's underpaid, she's overworked
Come on, man, shout one out to her

Stick that in your country song, come on
Take that one to number one, yeah
And get the whole world singing along
Stick that in your country song
Stick that in your country song
Take that one to number one, yeah (Number one, yeah)
And get the whole world singing along, yeah
Stick that in your country song, yeah (Hey! Oh)

Stick that in your country song, yeah (Oh)
Get the whole world singing along (Singin' along, oh)

Ol' Sunoco Charlie drives an '87 Harley
Sells gasoline and what you drink 8 to 3‚ÄÖAM
Got‚ÄÖa tattoo for‚ÄÖthe Corps and ex wife number‚ÄÖfour
Hummin' along, schoolin' you on the songs on his station
He could be another one cussin' the government, nah, but he smiles
Got hundred reasons not to, but he's the poster child for

Happy is as happy does
Grab a six string, find a rope swing
Hang a palm tree in your truck
Drink a beer just because
Steal a slow dance in a rain storm
And a kiss from who you love
Laugh and live with a half-full cup
Yeah, happy is as happy does

Some find it in the scripture or a Polaroid picture
Or flip a coin, heads, you're goin' to Tucson, Arizona
But it damn sure ain't in the lookin' back on the stuff you never did
Sometimes, you're gonna feel that, but life is better when

Happy is as happy does
Grab a six string, find a rope swing
Hang a palm tree in your truck
Drink a beer just because
Steal a slow dance in a rain storm
And a kiss from who you love
Laugh and live with a half-full cup
'Cause happy is as happy does

She's a long way from the old her
In this mountain dive in Boulder
Every pickle jar, crinkled dollar
Takes her another mile high

Happy is as happy does
Grab a six string, find a rope swing
Hang a palm tree in your truck
Drink a beer just because
Steal a slow dance in a rain storm
And a kiss from who you love
Laugh and live with a half-full cup
When it's all black clouds, find the sun
'Cause happy is as happy does

Happy is as happy does
Laugh and live with a half-full cup

Take off your makeup, nobody's around
It's you and me, girl, just let your guard down
I see right through you, I know what it means
I know I got you, the moment when you close your eye-eye-eyes
I know I'm doing something right-ight-ight

I got you down to a t-shirt, white sheets, red wine
Baby, you don't wanna leave
You want a record with some reverb, backbeat and low light
You know I know what you need tonight
Girl, I'll take my ti-ime, dot every I, I, baby, I, I
I got you down to a T
Mmm

Stay here 'til sunrise, I wanna know you
Like it's the last time I'll ever hold you
Girl, every detail leave it up to me
Lay back and let go
You don't even have to say-ay-ay anything
About the way-ay-ay

You should see how you look in that t-shirt
White sheets and red wine
Baby, you don't wanna leave
You want a record with some reverb, backbeat and low light
You know I know what you need tonight
Girl, I'll take my ti-ime, dot every I, I, baby, I, I
I got you down to a T
Whoa, yeah, yeah

Got you down, got you down (Got you down, down)
Got you down, got you down (Got you down, down)
Don't worry, baby
'Cause driving you crazy is all I ever wanted

Now that I got you down to a t-shirt
White sheets and red wine, mmm
You want a record with some reverb, backbeat and low light
You know I know what you need tonight
Girl, I'll take my ti-ime, dot every I, I, baby, I, I

First time I met you, knew I never could forget you, girl
You always saw the blue skies past the rain clouds in my eyes
There's music in your laughter from the floor up to the rafters
You're that happy ever after I've been after my whole life

Who knows where I'd be without you?
No, I just couldn't be without you
I'll just say "Amen"
I can count 'em on one hand
But honey, look there on your finger
I'd say I'm a lucky man
God made two lovers out of strangers
A little house on a little land
A little creek, a little Jeep
Same old moon everybody sees
It sure ain't hard to count your blessings

Yesterday we celebrated our first year together
And together still feels better than that first night we met
I never dreamed that you could be so perfectly created, girl
He made a perfect angel
And he made you just for me

Who knows where I'd be without you?
No, I just couldn't be without you
I'll just say "Amen"
I can count 'em on one hand
But honey, look there on your finger
I'd say I'm a lucky man
God made two lovers out of strangers
A little house on a little land
A little creek, a little Jeep
Same old moon everybody sees
It sure ain't hard to count your blessings

No, I can't count 'em on both hands
But honey, look here at this picture
I'd say we're a lucky fam
I'm thankful to be with you
A little house on a little land
Couple kids, two or three
Same old song that we'll always sing
It sure ain't hard to count your blessings
Always take time to count your blessings

One of us still has our picture taped up on the dash
One of us took that one from Mexico, threw it in the trash
One of us don't even notice when the radio plays that song
One of us breaks down and has to pull over whenever it comes on
Nah there ain't no in between, when it comes to her and me

One of us moved on, one of us got stuck
One of us is drinkin' just for fun, one of us drinkin' to get drunk
One of us sleeps good, and one of us hates to face the night
Just depends if you're talkin' about her world or mine

There's a number on a phone that one of us erased
There's a "late-night can we try again?" call one of us wants to make
'Cause one of us can't even think about bein' in another's arms
And there's a car in the drive that stayed all night, where one of us used to park

One of us moved on, one of us got stuck
One of us is drinkin' just for fun, one of us drinkin' to get drunk
One of us sleeps good, and one of us hates to face the night
Just depends if you're talkin' about her world or mine

For a while we had forever in our hands
That's why one of us can't understand

How one of us moved on, one of us got stuck
One of us is drinkin' just for fun, one of us drinkin' to get drunk
One of us sleeps good, one of us hates to face the night
Just depends if you're talkin' about her world or mine

Yeah that's the difference between her world or mine

I love the dimples in the small of your back
The way they're speaking to me just like that
Red wine made my imagination run
Oh, I can taste it on the tip of my tongue

Let it run, let it roll
Baby, I am under your control
Love me fast, kiss me slow
Hang on to anything you can hold

It's a long way down
To where I wanna go
It's a long way down
To the center of your soul
It's a long way down
And I'm a loaded gun
But I love your salt and sugar on the tip of my tongue

Girl, believe me when I say it's true
Nobody makes me feel the way you do
Well, I love you from the morning 'til the setting sun, yeah
I can taste the ocean on the tip of my tongue

Let it run, let it roll
Baby, I am under your control
Love me fast, kiss me slow
Hang onto anything you can hold

It's a long way down
To where I wanna go
It's a long way down
To the center of your soul
It's a long way down
And I'm a loaded gun
But I love your salt and sugar on the tip of my tongue
Yeah, I love your salt and sugar on the tip of my tongue

It's a long way down
It's a long way down

It's a long way down
And I'm a loaded gun
But I love your salt and sugar on the tip of my tongue
Yeah, I love your salt and sugar on the tip of my tongue

I wanna tell you that I think that you're the one
Oh girl, you know when it's all said and done
Everything about you's on the tip of my tongue

A cold beer's got twelve ounces
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long

When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all

The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good

'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old
Yeah, sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll

They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all


They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
And I know there'll be that moment
The good Lord calls one of us home and
One won't have the other by their side
But Heaven knows it, that won't last too long
Maybe some things last forever after all

After all

There ain't no "I" in beer

This why God put us here
Go 'head and check your Webster's
There ain't no "I" in beer

To the truck drivers shiftin' gears

There ain't no "I" in beer

Smoke was coming off my jacket and you didn't seem to mind
I left a long trail of ashes and you said, "I like your style"
Now, heartbreak ain't a competition, but I took it in a landslide
The skeletons I wanted to bury, you liked out in the light

You didn't save me
You didn't think I needed saving
You didn't change me
You didn't think I needed changing
My wings are frayed and what's left of my halo's black
Lucky for me, your kind of heaven's been to Hell and back
To Hell and back

I wonder how you treasure what anyone would call a flaw
You say a pearl without the pressure wouldn't be a pearl at all
When my demons come a-callin', you don‚Äôt even bat an eye
I don‚Äôt scare you, and I guess that‚Äôs why

You didn't save me
You didn't think I needed saving

There's days that I don't even want it on my mind but tonight I‚Äôm weak

Laugh and cry a little while reminiscing by myself
I can't help that all I think about is

It ain't the same here without you
I gotta say missin' you comes in waves
And tonight I'm drowning

Yeah, I know you're in a better place
One day I'll see you again
But It's killing me we can't be face to face

But the wine, the beer, the whiskey
They always get me

My friend named Gin, she's got some friends
I'm talkin' Brandy, Sherry, and their brother Jim
My friend the captain, we call him Morgan
He likes to anchor down and hang over 'til mornin'

Little bit of Red (Uh-huh)
A lotta bit of White (Oh, yeah)
Don't matter what it is, it's gonna make it all alright

The wine, the beer, the whiskey
Are the only things that fix me
I'm not sayin' it's a problem, I can stop it if I wanna
But the wine, the beer, the whiskey
They always get me

(Woo!)
(Oh, yeah, alright)
(Woo!)
My friend named Tito, he's my amigo
I'm gonna follow him around wherever he go (Woo)

The wine, the beer, the whiskey
Yeah, I got all my friends here with me
I'm not sayin' it's a problem, I can stop it if I wanna
But who would wanna?
When the wine, the beer, the whiskey
They always get me

They always get me (They always get me)
They always get me
Yeah, they always get me, they get me
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo (Ha-ha-ha, brr-brr-doo)

Well, I ain't gonna work today
Just wanna sit around and play
Gonna hit balls off the‚ÄÖdock
Kick‚ÄÖback in my‚ÄÖflip-flops
Don't owe nothin' to the lender
Nothin'‚ÄÖspinnin' in the blender
The only thing on my agenda is

Beers‚Åüand‚Åüsunshine
Bonfires‚Åüand summertime
Back porch‚Åünights in South‚ÅüCarolina
Ain't nothin' finer than me and my girl strikin' up a little lighter
'Cause everybody's down in a world gone crazy
Don't know how to fix it but I think maybe
Turn on the good times, turn off the TV
Yeah, the only B.S. I need is beers and sunshine

I'm gonna call my girl and say
Let's get our friends and hit the lake
Grab a boat and get to floatin'
A little buzzed and a little toasted
We're gonna hang and have a little fun now
Flying high like we'll never come down
We're gonna roll until we run out of

Beers and sunshine
Bonfires and summertime
Back porch nights in South Carolina
Ain't nothin' finer than me and my girl strikin' up a little lighter
'Cause everybody's down in a world gone crazy
Don't know how to fix it but I think maybe
Turn on the good times, turn off the TV
Yeah, the only B.S. I need is beers and sunshine
Oh, beers and sunshine, oh

Beers and sunshine
Bonfires and summertime
Back porch nights in South Carolina
Ain't nothin' finer than me and my girl strikin' up a little lighter
'Cause everybody's down in a world gone crazy
Don't know how to fix it but I think maybe
Turn on the good times, turn off the TV
Yeah, the only B.S. I need is beers and sunshine

Oh, beers and sunshine
Beers and sunshine
Bonfires and summertime, time, time
Oh, oh oh, yeah

I found myself in this bar
Makin' mistakes and makin‚Äô new friends
I was growin' up and‚ÄÖnothing‚ÄÖmade sense
Buzzin' all‚ÄÖnight like neon in the dark
I‚ÄÖfound myself in this

Couldn‚Äôt wait to turn 21
The day I did, I got too drunk
Spin around dizzy on the patio
Found out real quick how to take it slow
Got whiskey bent on whiskey sours
Ran my mouth to an out-of-towner
Learned a big lesson when I met the bouncer

I found myself in this bar
Makin' mistakes and makin' new friends
I was growin' up and nothing made sense
Buzzin' all night like neon in the dark
I found myself in this bar

Ooh-woah-ooh
Ooh-woah-ooh
Ooh-woah-ooh
I found myself in this bar

Saw her in the corner sippin' something tall
Cracked a few jokes, we hit off
Get down the road I'm watching her
Walk through the door with some new jerk
And we had it good, and it hurts so bad
But I had to stand my ground
Chased my pride with another round

I found myself in this bar
Makin' mistakes and makin‚Äô new friends
I was growin‚Äô up and nothin' made sense
Learnin‚Äô how to live with a broken heart
I found myself in this bar

Ooh-woah-ooh
Ooh-woah-ooh
Ooh-woah-ooh

Those nights, what I would give for one more
Bud Light, still kissin' on the front porch
Didn't even know what I was lookin' for

But I found myself in this bar
I found myself in this bar
I found myself in this bar
Ain‚Äôt it a stranger thing you keep tucked in your heart
I found myself in this bar

I know you're hurt, I know it's my fault
But I've kept "I'm sorry" locked in a vault
I know that time just keeps going on
And words by themselves can't right all the wrongs
In a world that's gone crazy, you don't know what's true
Most people don't change, but some people do

Some people quit drinking too much
And some people quit lying
Some people decide to grow up
But it's never good timing
Most wouldn't forgive what I put you through
But I'm here tonight, hoping some people do

Some people say sorry to hear it's okay
But I know it's not so you don't have to say
That you understand 'cause I know you don't
And neither do I, that don't mean that I won't
Try everyday to show you the truth
Most people don't change, but some people do

Some people quit drinking too much
And some people quit lying
Some people decide to grow up
But it's never good timing
Most wouldn't forgive what I put you through
But I'm here tonight, hoping some people do

So whether you kiss me or you close the door
Just know that I'm better than I was before

Some people quit drinking too much
And some people quit lying
Some people decide to grow up
But it's never good timing
Most wouldn't forgive what I put you through
But I'm here tonight, hoping some people do
I'm hoping some people do

<|EndOfSong|>

Oh yeah

Some people think You're distant, just some words on a page
That You're nothing more‚ÄÖthan‚ÄÖfables, handed down‚ÄÖalong the way
But I've seen You‚ÄÖpart the waters
When no one else could pull me from, the deep
That's who You are to me

Some people think You just live in cathedrals made of stone
But I know You live inside my heart, I know that it's Your home
And I've seen You in a sunset and in the eyes of a stranger on the street
That's who You are to me

You're amazing, faithful, love's open door
When I'm empty You fill me with hunger for more
Of Your mercy, Your goodness
Lord, You're the air that I breathe
That's who You are to me
Who You are to me

Sometimes I have my doubts, I'm sure that everybody does
And I wonder when I stumble, am I still worthy of Your love?
But I know that I get stronger when I'm talking to You down on my knees
You're everything I need

You're amazing, faithful, love's open door
When I'm empty You fill me with hunger for more
Of Your mercy, Your goodness
Lord, You're the air that I breathe
That's who You are to me
Who You are to me
Who You are to me

You're forever Holy
You're the Lamb who is worthy
My forgiveness (My forgiveness), my healer (My healer)
The Messiah, my Redeemer

You're amazing, faithful, love's open door
When I'm empty You fill me with hunger for more
Of Your mercy, Your goodness
Lord, You're the air that I breathe
(Lord, You're the air I breathe)
That's who You are

You are greater, higher over it all
In Your presence, Jesus, I stand in awe
Of Your mercy, Your goodness
Lord, You're the air that I breathe
That's who You are to me

That's who You are
That's who You are
That's who You are
That's who You are to me
That's who You are
That's who You are
That's who You are
That's who You are to me

We were just a couple years short of the age
By my name on a fake ID
And still 'bout a hundred away from the day
Your daddy said you could run with me
We were a couple of line steppers
Who just couldn‚Äôt wait to step over the line
Never thinkin' we wouldn't last
I was your first and you were mine

And we were leather jackets hangin‚Äô onto a Harley
Two heartbeats in the moonlight
We were both feet hangin' out over the edge
Of the water tower skyline
At least there's a little bit of sweet in the bitter
Though a part of me is always gonna miss her
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were
Mm-hmm

We were gonna make it, weren't we, baby?
Had it all laid out in our mind
By the time we knew time was runnin' out
We'd done run out of time
And we were downtown Saturday night, last-call cover band
'Til the last song played, never thought we'd fade
Like the stamp on the back of her hand

We were her on my shoulders, lighter in the air
"Pour Some Sugar On Me"
We were a top down at Johnson‚Äôs field
When she whispered that she wants me
At least there‚Äôs a little bit of sweet in the bitter
Though a part of me is always gonna miss her
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were
Oh, mm-hmm

We were leather jackets hangin' onto a Harley
Two heartbeats in the moonlight
We were both feet hangin‚Äô out over the edge
Of the water tower skyline
At least there's a little bit of sweet in the bitter
Though a part of me is always gonna miss her
I am who I am, I just miss who I was when we were
Mmm, yes, I do

My friends say
"Oh well, let that ship sail
You gotta let go of her"
Just wasn't meant to be
But somewhere down deep, I still believe
That we were

<|EndOfSong|>

A heart on the run keeps a hand on a gun
Can't trust anyone
I was so sure what I needed was more
Tried to shoot out the sun
The days when we raged, we flew off the page
Such damage was done
But I made it through, 'cause somebody knew
I was meant for someone

So, girl, leave your boots by the bed, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't goin' out to chop wood
So cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good

I put your faith to the test when I tore off your dress
In Richmond on High
I sobered up, I swore off that stuff
Forever this time
And the old lover's sing
‚ÄúI thought it'd be me who helped him get home‚Äù
But home was a dream
One that I'd never seen 'til you came along

So, girl, hang your dress out to dry, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til Percy Priest breaks open wide and the river runs through
And carries this house on its Stones like a piece of driftwood
Cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good

So, girl, leave your boots by the bed, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't goin' out to chop wood
So cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good
So cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good

Gaslighter, denier
Doin' anything to get your ass farther
Gaslighter, big timer
Repeating all of the mistakes of‚ÄÖyour‚ÄÖfather

We moved to‚ÄÖCalifornia and we followed your dreams
I‚ÄÖbelieved in the promises you made to me
Swore that night 'til death do us part
But you lie-lie-lie-lie-lied
Hollywood welcomed you with open doors
No matter what they gave you, you still wanted more
Acting all above it when our friends divorced
What a lie-lie-lie-lie-lie
You're such a

Gaslighter, denier
Doin' anything to get your ass farther
Gaslighter, big timer
Repeating all of the mistakes of your father
Gaslighter, you broke me
You're sorry, but where's my apology?
Gaslighter, you liar

You thought I wouldn't see it if you put it in my face
Give you all my money, you'll gladly walk away
You think it's justifiable, I think it's pretty cruel
And you know you lie best when you lie to you
'Cause, boy, you know exactly what you did on my boat
And, boy, that's exactly why you ain't comin' home
Save your tired stories for your new someone else
'Cause they're lie-lie-lie-lie-lies
Look out, you little

Gaslighter, denier
Doin' anything to get your ass farther (Ooh)
Gaslighter, big timer
Repeating all of the mistakes of your father
Gaslighter, you broke me
You're sorry, but where's my apology?
Gaslighter, you liar

Just had to start a fire, had to start a fire
Couldn't take yourself on a road a little higher
Had to burn it up, had to tear it down
Tried to say I'm crazy, babe, we know I'm not crazy, that's you
Gaslighting
You're a li-li-li-liar
Oh, honey, that's you
Gaslighting
You made your bed and then your bed caught fire

Gaslighter, I'm your mirror
Standin' right here until you can see how you broke me
Yeah, I'm broken
You're still sorry, and there's still no apology

Gaslighter, denier (Yeah)
Doin' anything to get your ass farther (Ooh)
Gaslighter, big timer
Repeating all of the mistakes of your father (Gaslighter)
Gaslighter, you broke me
You're sorry, but where's my apology?
Gaslighter, you liar

Sometimes her jacket smells like cigarettes
But she hates to smoke
And when I ask her who she's hangin' out with
She says no one I would know

Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I'm not
Maybe she's guilty, maybe she's caught

She's bringin' back cheatin' songs
The kinda hurt that gets you singin' along
Somethin' circa-1973
She's lyin' with him and she's lyin' to me
She's bringin' back diamond rings
Slipped in the pocket of her tight fittin' jeans
It's back in fashion doin' somebody wrong
She's bringin' back cheatin' songs

She used to call me on her way back home
But she don't call anymore
And when she's puttin' on that little black dress
Who's she wearin' it for?

Maybe I'm jealous; wouldn't you be?
If you saw the way she ain't lookin' at me

She's bringin' back cheatin' songs
The kinda hurt that gets you singin' along
Somethin' circa-1973
She's lyin' with him and she's lyin' to me
She's bringin' back diamond rings
Slipped in the pocket of her tight fittin' jeans
It's back in fashion doin' somebody wrong
She's bringin' back cheatin' songs

Steel guitars are back in style
Like tears fallin' over her smile
Yeah, it's been a while since country music loved a fool
Running around was cool

She's bringin' back cheatin' songs
The kinda hurt that gets you singin' along
Somethin' circa-1973
She's lyin' with him and she's lyin' to me
She's bringin' back diamond rings
Slipped in the pocket of her tight fittin' jeans
It's back in fashion doin' somebody wrong
She's bringin' back cheatin' songs
She's bringin' back cheatin' songs
